## What is UmaDev?

UmaDev is **a coding agent that works like a real dev team** — product manager, architect, UI/UX designer, frontend, backend, QA, security, and DevOps, each doing its own specialty on a shared blackboard. It is *firmware over a borrowed brain*. A **coordinator** seat (the team's technical lead) drives your already-logged-in base CLI — exactly three are first-class: **Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode** — to **route** your request, show you a **plan**, inject the team's **firmware** (engineering craft + anti-AI-slop taste + your project's knowledge + a map of your existing code), **schedule the team** step by step with a deterministic acceptance floor, and hand back a **proof-pack**. (Want a different model? That is the base's job — route it to a third-party / local model in the base's own config; UmaDev does not add new drivers for that.)

UmaDev itself doesn't write code: the brain stays in the base. The team decides what to produce and how deeply to engage, checks the result against a floor that can say no, and leaves an evidence trail. It owns **no model endpoint** and does not re-implement the base's agentic loop. Governance (no emoji icons, no hardcoded colors, no AI-template slop, contract alignment) is the safety net underneath the team.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install -g umadev

# 2. Initialize a project
cd my-project
umadev init

# 3. Launch the TUI
umadev
```

On first launch, pick your base (one of the three AI coding CLIs you've already logged into: Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode). Then type your requirement and press Enter.

## The 9-Phase Pipeline (the deep play, not every turn)

This chain is the **deepest play the coordinator routes to** for a full commercial greenfield build. A greeting stays chat, a one-line edit takes the fast path, a bugfix convenes no team; only a full product requirement expands the plan into this chain. (See the intent router in "What is UmaDev?" above, and spec §4.1 / §9.5.)

```
research → docs → ⏸ docs_confirm → spec → frontend → ⏸ preview_confirm → backend → quality → delivery
```

| Phase | What happens | Expert role |
|---|---|---|
| research | Competitive analysis, user discovery, design direction | Product Researcher |
| docs | PRD + Architecture + UI/UX design system | PM + Architect + Designer |
| docs_confirm | **GATE** — you review the 3 docs before coding starts | You |
| spec | Sprint breakdown, coding standards, task list | Engineering Manager |
| frontend | Base implements frontend with approved design tokens | Frontend Lead |
| preview_confirm | **GATE** — you review the frontend before backend | You |
| backend | Base implements API routes, database, auth, tests | Backend Lead |
| quality | 17 automated checks + 5-dimension visual review | QA Lead |
| delivery | Proof-pack zip with README + compliance mapping | Release Engineer |

> The 9 phases target a full commercial-grade delivery. Small tasks have a lighter path: the router classifies the request and the coordinator trims or expands the plan to fit — a bugfix convenes no team and is not pushed through the whole PRD / architecture / UIUX chain. Force the light path for a trivial change with `/quick`.

## Design Systems

UmaDev ships 5 design systems. Select one before running to get deterministic visual output:

| Name | Best for |
|---|---|
| `modern-minimal` | SaaS, dev tools, dashboards |
| `editorial-clean` | Blogs, content sites, portfolios |
| `tech-utility` | CLI companions, monitoring, data tools |
| `soft-warm` | Consumer apps, education, wellness |
| `bold-geometric` | Brand launches, creative agencies |

## Seed Templates

| Name | Structure |
|---|---|
| `saas-landing` | Nav → Hero → Trust → Features → Pricing → FAQ → Footer |
| `dashboard` | Sidebar + KPI cards + Charts + Data table |
| `blog-content` | Featured article + Grid + Newsletter |
| `e-commerce` | Gallery + Product info + Variants + Reviews + Related |
| `auth-system` | Login + Signup + Forgot + MFA + Reset |
| `settings-page` | Sidebar tabs + Profile + Security + Billing |
| `docs-site` | Sidebar nav + Content + Code blocks + Search |

## Configuration

### `.umadevrc` (project-level)

```toml
[quality]
threshold = 85              # quality gate pass threshold (default: 90)
skip_checks = ["dark_mode"] # skip specific checks

[pipeline]
skip_phases = ["research"]  # skip phases you don't need
max_review_rounds = 2       # limit auto-fix cycles (default: 3)

[experts]
custom_knowledge = "team-standards/"  # additional knowledge directory
```

### `~/.umadev/config.toml` (user-level)

```toml
backend = "claude-code"
# model is empty by default — the base uses its own configured model.
# Set it (or pass `umadev run --model <id>`) only to override.
# model = "opus"
design_system = "modern-minimal"
seed_template = "dashboard"
```

## Quality Gate

UmaDev runs 17 automated checks:

| Category | Checks |
|---|---|
| Artifacts | Research, PRD, Architecture, UIUX — content structure validation |
| Cross-reference | PRD↔Architecture route alignment, API URL consistency |
| Code quality | Emoji check, hardcoded colors, anti-AI-slop patterns |
| Design | UIUX token count, dark mode presence, design system completeness |
| Evidence | Audit log, tool-call log, discovery section |
| Depth | Acceptance criteria count, API route count |

## Expert Knowledge

Each pipeline phase is backed by a specialist's methodology:

| Expert | Knowledge | Used in |
|---|---|---|
| Product Manager | RICE scoring, AC format, edge cases, HEART metrics | Research, PRD |
| Architect | API design standards, security checklist (OWASP), auth patterns | Architecture |
| UI/UX Designer | Token architecture, interaction principles, WCAG 2.1, responsive | UIUX, Frontend |
| Frontend Lead | Component architecture, state management, error handling, performance | Frontend |
| Backend Lead | API handler pattern, database practices, JWT flow, logging standards | Backend |
| QA Lead | Test pyramid, AC→test conversion, pre-release checklist | Quality |
| DevOps | CI/CD pipeline, Docker, monitoring, rollback strategy | Delivery |

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need an API key?**
No. UmaDev drives your already-logged-in AI coding CLI. It uses your existing subscription.

**Q: What if the base times out?**
UmaDev retries once. If it still fails, it falls back to an offline template with TODO markers. You can `/redo` to try again.

**Q: Can I customize the quality checks?**
Yes, via `.umadevrc`. Set `skip_checks` to disable specific checks, or `threshold` to change the pass score.

**Q: Does it work offline?**
Offline is a fallback, not the product. Without a base reachable, it generates structured templates with TODO markers — useful for planning, CI smoke tests, or demos, but not a substitute for real development. Real delivery always runs through one of the three bases.
