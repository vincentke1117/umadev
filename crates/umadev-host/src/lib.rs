//! `umadev-host` — drive an already-logged-in host CLI as a subprocess.
//!
//! In base-CLI mode UmaDev does not call any LLM API itself and does not
//! need an API key. Instead it spawns a host CLI the user has already installed
//! and authenticated, in non-interactive mode, and captures the response.
//!
//! UmaDev drives **exactly three** host CLIs as first-class bases:
//!
//! | id            | binary    | non-interactive form                              |
//! |---------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
//! | `claude-code` | `claude`  | `claude --print --output-format text "<p>"`       |
//! | `codex`       | `codex`   | `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check --sandbox …`    |
//! | `opencode`    | `opencode`| `opencode run "<p>"`                              |
//!
//! Each driver implements [`umadev_runtime::Runtime`] so the existing
//! `AgentRunner` machinery drives it unchanged — a host CLI is just
//! another "prompt in, text out" backend. Drivers additionally expose
//! [`HostDriver::probe`] to report whether the underlying CLI is installed +
//! reachable before a run starts.
//!
//! Run `umadev doctor` to see which of the supported CLIs are installed on
//! the current machine.
//!
//! UmaDev drives only these three CLIs and owns no model endpoint of its own.
//! Whatever a base is already configured with — official login OR the customer's
//! own third-party / local-model routing — is exactly what runs.
