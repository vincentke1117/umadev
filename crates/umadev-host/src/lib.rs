//! `umadev-host` — drive an already-logged-in host CLI as a subprocess.
//!
//! In base-CLI mode UmaDev does not call any LLM API itself and does not
//! need an API key. Instead it spawns a host CLI the user has already installed
//! and authenticated, through its machine protocol. The child does not render
//! its own TUI; user interaction remains live and bidirectional in UmaDev.
//!
//! UmaDev drives five host CLIs as first-class bases. Claude Code, Codex, and
//! `OpenCode` use vendor-specific protocols; Grok Build and Kimi Code use
//! vendor-isolated policies over the hardened ACP v1 transport core.
//!
//! | id            | binary    | continuous machine session                         |
//! |---------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
//! | `claude-code` | `claude`  | bidirectional stream-json                          |
//! | `codex`       | `codex`   | app-server JSON-RPC                                |
//! | `opencode`    | `opencode`| HTTP + SSE persistent session                      |
//! | `grok-build`  | `grok`    | ACP v1 over newline-delimited JSON-RPC             |
//! | `kimi-code`   | `kimi`    | ACP v1 over newline-delimited JSON-RPC             |
//!
//! Each driver implements [`umadev_runtime::Runtime`] so the existing
//! `AgentRunner` machinery drives it unchanged — a host CLI is just
//! another "prompt in, text out" backend. Drivers additionally expose
//! [`HostDriver::probe`] to report whether the underlying CLI is installed +
//! reachable before a run starts.
//!
//! Run `umadev doctor` to see which of the supported CLIs are installed on
//! the current machine.
//!
//! UmaDev owns no model endpoint of its own.
//! Whatever a base is already configured with — official login OR the customer's
//! own third-party / local-model routing — is exactly what runs.
