//! Opt-in **process-log visibility** for the base's long-running commands.
//!
//! # The swallow this addresses
//!
//! A native base (`claude` / `codex` / `opencode`) runs a long shell command —
//! a Maven / Gradle / `npm`/`cargo` build, a `spring-boot:run`, a dependency install —
//! inside its OWN agentic tool loop and its OWN sandbox. The base CAPTURES that
//! command's stdout/stderr internally and only hands UmaDev a single, structured
//! `tool_result` (codex: a `commandExecution` item's `aggregatedOutput`) when the
//! command FINISHES — and each driver then clips that preview to a tight
//! the internal default cap of 200 characters. So during a multi-minute build the user sees
//! a silent "thinking" with no log lines, and even at the end only a 200-char
//! clip — the logs feel "swallowed by the sandbox redirect."
//!
//! There is no raw byte stream of the running command available from the base's
//! wire protocol (the base owns the pipe), so UmaDev cannot tail the file the
//! sandbox redirects to. What IT can do, when the user opts in, is (1) surface the
//! FULL captured output instead of a 200-char clip, and (2) for the codex
//! app-server — whose item lifecycle DOES emit `item/started` + `item/updated`
//! frames as the command runs — surface the running command immediately and stream
//! its growing output, so the multi-minute void becomes a live, progressing log.
//!
//! # The toggle
//!
//! [`SHOW_PROCESS_LOGS_ENV`] (`UMADEV_SHOW_PROCESS_LOGS`) — truthy turns it on at
//! launch. The live flag, however, is process-wide **thread-safe shared state**
//! (an [`AtomicBool`]), NOT the process env: the TUI seeds it from the saved
//! preference / env at startup and flips it live via the `/logs` command through
//! [`set_show_process_logs`], while the three native base drivers read it per
//! streaming event via [`show_process_logs`]. **OFF by default**: every driver behaves
//! exactly as before.
//!
//! ## Why not the env
//!
//! The drivers read this flag from background tokio tasks that live for the whole
//! session, while a `/logs` toggle runs on a different task. `std::env::set_var` /
//! `std::env::var` (POSIX `setenv`/`getenv`) are **not** thread-safe — a runtime
//! `setenv` racing a concurrent `getenv` is a data race (UB: can segfault / read a
//! freed `environ` slot). So the live value lives in an `AtomicBool`; the env is
//! read **once** at startup only, to seed it (an external launch override still
//! works), and is never mutated at runtime.
//!
//! Fail-open by contract: every function here is total and never panics — an unset
//! / unparsable env seeds "off", and the cap always returns a usable bound.
