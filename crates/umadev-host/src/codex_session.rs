//! `CodexSession` — the **continuous-session** driver for the `codex` base.
//!
//! This is the long-lived counterpart to [`crate::codex::CodexDriver`]. Where
//! `CodexDriver` is "one prompt → one text blob" (a fresh `codex exec`
//! subprocess per call), `CodexSession` keeps a SINGLE `codex app-server`
//! process alive for an entire 9-phase run: context flows research → docs →
//! code without re-priming, the base runs its own agentic tool loop (it WRITES
//! files), and the orchestrator observes a stream of tool-call / text / done
//! events. It implements [`umadev_runtime::BaseSession`].
//!
//! It does **not** replace `CodexDriver`; the two co-exist. The single-shot
//! `codex exec --json` path in `codex.rs` is untouched.
//!
//! # Wire protocol — `codex app-server` (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio)
//!
//! Verified against OpenAI's official Codex App Server documentation:
//!
//! - <https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server>
//! - <https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/app-server/README.md>
//!
//! Transport is **newline-delimited JSON** over the child's stdin/stdout. Per
//! the spec, messages are JSON-RPC 2.0 *with the `"jsonrpc":"2.0"` member
//! omitted on the wire* — so we neither send nor require it. The earlier
//! `codex proto` mode is deprecated; `codex app-server` is the current entry
//! point.
//!
//! Handshake (per the README's "Every connection must start with `initialize`
//! followed by `initialized`"):
//!
//! 1. `initialize` request `{clientInfo, capabilities}` → wait for its result.
//! 2. `initialized` notification (client → server, no id).
//! 3. `thread/start {model, cwd, approvalPolicy, sandbox}` → result carries
//!    `thread.id` + `thread.sessionId`.
//!
//! Per-phase injection (same thread = context flows):
//! `turn/start {threadId, input:[{type:"text", text:"<directive>"}]}`.
//!
//! Observed notifications (server → client, no id) → [`SessionEvent`]:
//! - `item/agentMessage/delta {delta}` → [`SessionEvent::TextDelta`].
//! - `item/completed` with item `type:"commandExecution"` (the `command`) /
//!   `type:"fileChange"` (the `changes[]` paths) → [`SessionEvent::ToolCall`] /
//!   [`SessionEvent::ToolResult`]. **This is the source of truth** for what the
//!   base actually did.
//! - `turn/completed {turn:{status}}` (`completed` / `interrupted` / `failed`)
//!   → [`SessionEvent::TurnDone`].
//!
//! Governance / gates: when `approvalPolicy` is left at `never` the base never
//! asks; at a gate the policy is non-`never` and the server sends a
//! server-initiated REQUEST `item/commandExecution/requestApproval` /
//! `item/fileChange/requestApproval` (has both `method` and `id`) which becomes
//! [`SessionEvent::NeedApproval`]; the reply is `{id, result:{approved: bool}}`.
//!
//! Control: `turn/interrupt {threadId, turnId}` (interrupt),
//! `turn/steer {threadId, turnId, input}` (queue input mid-turn),
//! a fresh read-only `thread/start` on its own app-server (the read-only critic
//! fork — a clean, independent thread, NOT a branch/resume of the main line),
//! `thread/resume {threadId}` (writable crash recovery).
//!
//! **Fail-open by contract:** any parse failure, a JSON-RPC `error` (e.g. the
//! `-32001` "overloaded" surface), or the child process dying mid-turn
//! surfaces a [`TurnStatus::Failed`] / `next_event` → `None`. The driver never
//! panics — a bug here must never crash the host.
