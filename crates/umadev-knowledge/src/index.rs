//! BM25 inverted index — the default (offline, zero-dependency) retrieval engine.
//!
//! BM25 is the industry-standard lexical ranking function (what Elasticsearch
//! / Lucene use). It outperforms plain TF-IDF by saturating term frequency,
//! so a term appearing 100× in one doc isn't 100× more relevant than 10×.
//!
//! The index is a pure data structure: build once from chunks, query N times.
//! It serialises to `.umadev/kb-index/bm25.bin` (via serde_json) and is
//! rebuilt only when source `.md` mtimes change (see [`load_or_build_index`]).
//!
//! ## Why not HNSW here?
//! HNSW (`hnsw_rs`) is the vector layer in [`crate::vector`]. BM25 is
//! keyword-exact and needs no approximate search — a flat inverted index
//! scanned per query term is both faster and deterministic for this corpus
//! size (hundreds of chunks).
