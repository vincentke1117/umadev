//! Retrieval-quality feedback — a per-chunk **usefulness prior** that lets the
//! curated-knowledge ranking SELF-TUNE from build outcomes.
//!
//! Static BM25 / vector / RRF ranking answers "which chunk best matches the
//! query?" but never learns from what happened after a chunk was injected. This
//! module adds a thin, bounded, fail-open memory: a chunk that preceded a CLEAN
//! step earns a usefulness boost; one that preceded a FAILURE is demoted. Over
//! many runs the corpus's own track record nudges ranking, WITHOUT discarding
//! lexical/semantic relevance. Retrieval blends only 10% of this prior, so it can
//! resolve a near tie but cannot overrule materially stronger current evidence.
//!
//! ## Where it lives (cross-project)
//!
//! The curated `knowledge/` corpus is shared across every project, so its track
//! record is too: the store is a single JSON file under the user home
//! (`~/.umadev/knowledge-usefulness.json`), NOT per-project. A per-project
//! transient "which chunks were surfaced for this step" snapshot lives in the
//! agent crate (mirroring its surfaced-lesson-identity snapshot); this module
//! only owns the durable, cross-project prior it feeds.
//!
//! ## Conservatism contract
//!
//! - **Sample-gated.** Below [`crate::usefulness::MIN_SAMPLES`] observations a chunk's weight is
//!   NEUTRAL (`1.0`) — a single observation never moves ranking, and a fresh
//!   corpus (no observations at all) ranks byte-for-byte as before.
//! - **Bounded weight.** Once well-sampled the weight stays within
//!   `[WEIGHT_MIN, WEIGHT_MAX]` (`0.3..=1.2`) — a proven-helpful chunk lifts, a
//!   proven-harmful one sinks, but relevance still dominates.
//! - **Bounded store.** At most [`crate::usefulness::MAX_ENTRIES`] chunk keys are retained
//!   (least-recently-updated evicted first, deterministically).
//! - **Fail-open.** A missing / corrupt / unwritable store degrades to the
//!   neutral prior (today's static ranking) — never a panic, never an error.
//! - **Deterministic.** Pure integer bookkeeping + a fixed weight map; no clock
//!   read decides ranking, no brain consult, reproducible run-to-run.
