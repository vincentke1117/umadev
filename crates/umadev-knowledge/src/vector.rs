//! Optional semantic vector layer — only active when an OpenAI API key
//! is set AND the `vector` cargo feature is enabled at compile time.
//!
//! When enabled, chunks are embedded via the user's existing OpenAI
//! subscription (`/v1/embeddings`, `text-embedding-3-small`, 1536-dim) and
//! the vectors are searched with brute-force cosine similarity.
//!
//! ## Activation contract
//! 1. **Compile time**: the `vector` cargo feature is on (`--features
//!    umadev-knowledge/vector`). Without it, this whole module compiles
//!    to the offline stub and pulls in zero HTTP dependencies.
//! 2. **Local first (the shipped default)**: with the `vector-local` feature
//!    and the bundled candle model present, embedding runs fully on-device —
//!    no key, no network. Zero setup; this is what a default install uses.
//! 3. **Cloud embedding is OFF by default — explicit opt-in only**: sending
//!    corpus or query text to a REMOTE embeddings endpoint requires BOTH the
//!    dedicated `OPENAI_EMBED_KEY` **and** an explicit `UMADEV_ALLOW_CLOUD_EMBED=1`
//!    opt-in (the single decision seam is the internal `cloud_embed_key`). The generic
//!    `OPENAI_API_KEY` NEVER authorizes an upload — a user who set it for some
//!    unrelated OpenAI tool must never have their curated corpus silently
//!    shipped to the cloud.
//! 4. **Config**: `.umadevrc [knowledge] engine = "hybrid"`.
//!
//! `is_enabled()` reports whether a vector *retrieval* channel is plausibly
//! available (a local model, or any OpenAI key for a pre-built / remote store);
//! it gates fusion, NOT uploads. The actual network embed calls are gated
//! strictly by the internal `cloud_embed_key`, so when cloud embedding is not explicitly
//! opted in the retriever transparently uses the local model or BM25 only —
//! never the cloud.
//!
//! ## Why not HNSW?
//! `hnsw_rs` requires edition-2024 / Rust ≥1.85 and adds a non-trivial
//! dependency. For a corpus of hundreds-to-low-thousands of chunks, a flat
//! `Vec<Vec<f32>>` cosine scan is sub-millisecond and has zero dependencies.
//! HNSW only matters at millions of vectors — out of scope here. (If the
//! corpus ever grows that large, this module is the single swap point.)
//!
//! ## Network policy (fail-open, local-first)
//! - Default install → LOCAL candle embedding, else BM25. No corpus ever leaves
//!   the machine.
//! - Cloud embedding runs ONLY when the user explicitly opts in
//!   (`OPENAI_EMBED_KEY` + `UMADEV_ALLOW_CLOUD_EMBED=1`); a generic
//!   `OPENAI_API_KEY` alone never triggers a network embed.
//! - Cloud opted-in but network fails → returns empty results, logs a warning.
//!   Retrieval NEVER blocks the pipeline; the local model / BM25 is always the
//!   fallback.
//!
//! ## Storage
//! Vectors are cached at `.umadev/kb-index/vectors.bin` (a serde blob).
//! Each stored vector carries a `body_hash` so cache entries are invalidated
//! per-chunk when the source markdown changes, and a `chunk_idx` to align
//! with the BM25 index's positional model (avoiding `(path, section)`
//! collisions when two H2 headings share a name). Re-embedding only happens
//! for chunks whose `body_hash` differs from the cached value.
