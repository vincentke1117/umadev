//! Coach mode — writes a self-contained instruction file per phase that the
//! selected one of five bases executes (three native plus Grok Build/Kimi Code over ACP).
//!
//! UmaDev does not need an API key when running inside a host that
//! already has model access. Instead of calling the model itself, the
//! coach writes a deterministic prompt file the host can read and
//! follow. After the host produces the required artifact, the user
//! runs `umadev continue` and UmaDev verifies + advances.
//!
//! This module is the *single source of truth* for what each phase
//! tells the host to do. Each `coach_<phase>` returns a complete
//! markdown document with:
//!
//! 1. The spec preamble (non-negotiable rules from
//!    `UMADEV_HOST_SPEC_V1`).
//! 2. The expert role definition.
//! 3. The task description.
//! 4. The required output path + section structure.
//! 5. The input context (requirement, knowledge digest, prior artifacts).
//! 6. The next step (`umadev continue`).

## Spec preamble (non-negotiable)\n\n\
You are operating inside a UmaDev pipeline run governed by \
`UMADEV_HOST_SPEC_V1`. Every artifact you produce MUST follow these \
rules:\n\n\
### Technical rules\n\
- Use a declared icon library (Lucide / Heroicons / Tabler). NEVER \
  emoji as functional icons.\n\
- Use design tokens (CSS vars / theme keys). NEVER hardcoded hex / \
  rgb / hsl colors in production UI.\n\
- Frontend `fetch` URLs MUST match an API path declared in the \
  architecture document.\n\
- Wait for explicit user approval at `docs_confirm` and \
  `preview_confirm` gates.\n\
- Output goes into structured markdown sections — do not invent new \
  top-level sections, fill the ones requested below.\n\n\
### Visual quality rules\n\
- Typography drives hierarchy: set a type scale before touching layout.\n\
- Generous whitespace: spacing tokens, not cramped divs.\n\
- Real-looking placeholder content, not \"Lorem ipsum\" or \"Example\".\n\
- Every interactive element needs hover + focus + disabled states.\n\
- No purple/pink gradient hero sections unless the product domain demands it.\n\
- No default-system-font-only designs; always declare a font stack.\n\
- No \"Welcome to [App]\" giant centered headings with no actual content.\n\
- No AI-chatbot shell layouts unless the product IS a chatbot.\n\
- Dark mode is REQUIRED. Every UIUX doc MUST include a `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` \
  block that overrides surface/text/border tokens. Every frontend MUST wire it.\

         1. **Print ALL THREE documents as your text reply.** Do NOT use Edit/Write tools.\n\
         2. **Read `output/{slug}-research.md` FIRST** — especially the Discovery section \
            and Design system recommendation. Bind your UIUX tokens to the direction chosen there.\n\
         3. **UIUX MUST include `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block** — dark mode is REQUIRED.\n\
         4. **Separate the three documents with `---` on its own line.**\n\n\
         ## Role\n\nThree domain experts in sequence:\n\n\
         1. **Senior Product Manager** — testable acceptance criteria, no ambiguity.\n\
         2. **Senior Software Architect** — consistent API surface, justified tech choices.\n\
         3. **Senior UI/UX Designer** — full design system (tokens + dark mode + components + states).\n\n\
         ## Task\n\nProduce the three core documents. Read the research brief FIRST, \
         then build each doc on the previous one.\n\n\
         ## Required outputs\n\n\
         ### 1. PRD — `output/{slug}-prd.md`\n\
         - `# PRD — {slug}`\n\
         - `## Goal` (2-4 sentences)\n\
         - `## Scope` (`in` and `out` bullets)\n\
         - `## User stories` (3-7 stories in `As a … I want … so that …` form)\n\
         - `## Acceptance criteria` (testable checkbox list, 5-10 items)\n\
         - `## Risks & open questions`\n\n\
         ### 2. Architecture — `output/{slug}-architecture.md`\n\
         - `# Architecture — {slug}`\n\
         - `## System overview` (1-3 paragraphs)\n\
         - `## Target platform & tech stack` (REQUIRED) — 商业开发不只 web。明确目标平台: \
           web / 移动 App(iOS/Android/鸿蒙) / 桌面(Win/macOS/Linux) / 小程序(微信/支付宝/…) / \
           或多端。声明每端的技术栈与理由(原生 vs 跨平台框架 Flutter/RN/uni-app/Taro/Tauri/KMP), \
           哪些代码共享(业务逻辑/数据/契约)、哪些按平台(UI/交互遵循各端设计规范 HIG/Material/HarmonyOS Design/小程序指南)。\
           后续客户端实现 MUST 按声明的平台与其平台标准来,不要默认只做 web。\n\
         - `## Architecture & layering` (REQUIRED, 商业级结构决策) — declare a \
           layered / clean architecture: interface(controller, 仅传输) → \
           application(service, 编排+事务, 一个用例=一个方法=一个事务边界, 收发 DTO 不泄露 entity) \
           → domain(entity/VO, 业务规则与不变量, 不要贫血) → infrastructure(repository/adapter, 持久化与外部); \
           dependencies flow inward. THEN list the **feature-module decomposition** \
           (package-by-feature: e.g. `orders` / `payments` / `users` / `auth`, each \
           with its own interface/application/domain/infrastructure; cross-module via \
           service interfaces / domain events). This section is binding — the backend \
           phase MUST build exactly these modules and layers.\n\
         - `## API surface` (markdown table `| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |` with ≥5 rows; \
           every path starts with `/`; mark which endpoints require auth)\n\
         - `## Data model` (entities + fields + relations + key constraints/indexes; \
           金额非 float, 时间带时区)\n\
         - `## Tech-stack rationale` (one sentence per choice)\n\
         - `## Open trade-offs`\n\n\
         ### 3. UI/UX — `output/{slug}-uiux.md`\n\n\
         **IMPORTANT**: Before writing, check if `knowledge/design-systems/` exists in \
         the workspace. If it does, read the design system that matches the direction \
         chosen in the research brief's Discovery section (e.g. if \"Modern Minimal\" → \
         read `knowledge/design-systems/modern-minimal.md`). Use its color palette, \
         typography, spacing, and component patterns as your BINDING CONTRACT — copy \
         the CSS `:root` tokens verbatim, don't reinvent them.\n\n\
         If no matching design system file exists, create tokens from scratch following \
         the direction chosen below.\n\n\
         - `# UI/UX — {slug}`\n\
         - `## Visual direction` — pick ONE direction that fits the product domain. \
           Consider these archetypes:\n\
           - **Editorial Clean** — magazine-like, serif-accent headings, generous whitespace, \
             photography-driven. Best for: content sites, blogs, portfolio.\n\
           - **Modern Minimal** — geometric sans-serif, precise spacing, monochrome with one accent. \
             Best for: SaaS, dev tools, dashboards.\n\
           - **Tech Utility** — monospace accents, dense information, dark-mode-native. \
             Best for: CLI companions, code platforms, data tools.\n\
           - **Soft Warm** — rounded corners, warm palette, friendly illustrations. \
             Best for: consumer apps, education, wellness.\n\
           - **Bold Geometric** — high contrast, oversized type, asymmetric grid. \
             Best for: creative agencies, portfolios, brand launches.\n\
           State which you chose and ONE sentence why it fits this product. \
           Pick 1-3 recognizable, real reference products IN THE TARGET'S OWN DOMAIN \
           as anchors, and for each borrow ONE specific move (e.g. information density \
           from one, type treatment from another, surface/depth from a third) — name \
           the move, not just the product. Name THE ONE memorable thing, \
           and write one AVOID line. Then define ALL tokens deterministically from \
           that choice — the frontend phase COPIES these tokens, it does not reinvent them.\n\
         - `## Color palette` — a `:root` CSS block with semantic tokens in a 3-layer \
           architecture (primitive `--blue-600` → semantic `--color-primary` → \
           component); components reference ONLY semantic/component tokens, never raw hex; \
           dark mode overrides the SEMANTIC layer. \
           Require at minimum: `--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text`, \
           `--color-text-secondary`, `--color-primary`, `--color-primary-hover`, \
           `--color-accent`, `--color-border`, `--color-error`, `--color-success`. \
           Name text tokens by EMPHASIS (ink/body/muted) not gray-number; name surfaces \
           by ELEVATION step; pair every dark surface with an on-dark text token; use a \
           near-black/near-white (NEVER #000/#fff) with neutrals tinted toward the brand \
           hue; ONE scarce accent (≤3%% of viewport). \
           NO purple/pink gradients unless the product domain demands it.\n\
         - `## Dark mode` (put this RIGHT AFTER color palette) — a complete \
           `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block that overrides \
           bg/surface/text/border/shadow tokens. This is NOT optional.\n\
         - `## Typography system` — font stack (2 families max: one for headings, \
           one for body), type scale (7 steps: `--text-xs` through `--text-3xl`) with \
           BIG jumps (ratio ≥1.25, display 48-96px). Scale negative letter-spacing with \
           size on display (-0.01 to -0.04em), POSITIVE tracking on uppercase eyebrows \
           (+0.05 to +0.12em); display weight ceiling ≤600; line-height + weight tokens. \
           Add ONE signature detail (an OpenType stylistic set on body — ss01/ss03 — or \
           tabular-nums on money) so the type is not generic default Inter. NO \
           system-font-only.\n\
         - `## Spacing scale` — mathematical progression (4px base), at least 8 \
           steps from `--space-1` (4px) to `--space-12` (48px).\n\
         - `## Icon library` — declare exactly ONE: Lucide / Heroicons / Tabler.\n\
         - `## Page hierarchy` — nested list with route paths.\n\
         - `## Component inventory` — list every component the frontend needs, with \
           states: default / hover / active / disabled / loading / error.\n\
         - `## Motion guidelines` — duration buckets as tokens (fast ~120ms / base \
           ~220ms / slow ~420ms; exit ≈ 75%% of enter), a crafted ease-out \
           (`cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)`) NOT bounce/elastic, animate transform/opacity \
           only, one orchestrated page-load reveal, and a required \
           `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block.\n\
         - `## Anti-patterns` — 5 things this design explicitly avoids \
           (e.g. \"no decorative hero gradients\", \"no AI-chat-shell layout\", \
           \"no emoji as functional icons\").\n\
         - `## Self-critique` — score this design on 5 dimensions (1-10 each): \
           Hierarchy clarity / Visual distinctiveness / Detail polish / \
           Functional completeness / Innovation. If any ≤ 6, revise before submitting.\n\
         - `## Accessibility notes` — contrast ratios, focus rings, ARIA landmarks.\n\n\
         ## Input\n\n\
         ### Requirement\n\n{req}\n\n\
         ### Research brief\n\n\
         Read `output/{slug}-research.md` for context.\n\n\

        "## Role\n\nSenior frontend engineer + visual craftsperson.\n\n\
         ## Task\n\nImplement a production-grade frontend that looks \
         professionally designed — not like an AI template.\n\n\
         ## Platform FIRST (按架构文档声明的目标平台来)\n\n\
         - Read the architecture doc's `## Target platform & tech stack`. Build the CLIENT for \
           THAT platform with its stack and follow its platform standard — web, mobile \
           (iOS/Android/鸿蒙), desktop (Tauri/Electron), or mini-program (微信/支付宝/uni-app). \
           Do NOT default to a web SPA if another platform was declared. UI/交互遵循该端设计规范 \
           (HIG / Material / HarmonyOS Design / 小程序指南). The scaffolding/build/run commands \
           below assume web — adapt them to the declared platform's toolchain.\n\n\
         ## Structure FIRST (商业级客户端架构)\n\n\
         - Organize **by feature** (`features/<x>/{{api,components,hooks,types}}`), not by type. \
           Cross-feature only via each feature's public index; no deep imports.\n\
         - **Data access isolated**: NO raw `fetch`/`axios` inside components — all requests go \
           through a typed API layer (per-feature `api/` module); paths match the architecture \
           doc; handle loading / error / empty for every data view.\n\
         - **State三类分治**: server data via React Query/SWR (don't hand-manage in Redux), \
           global client state via a store, UI state local.\n\
         - **Logic out of JSX**: computation/validation/derivation in pure functions/hooks; \
           presentational vs container components separated.\n\
         - **查阅前端/客户端标准库**：`knowledge/<platform>/01-standards/` 附带商业级标准——\
           web(web-framework-best-practices React/Next/Vue · forms · admin-dashboard-and-crud · i18n · accessibility · seo)、\
           移动(mobile + ios-design-hig/android-material-design)、鸿蒙(harmonyos-design)、小程序(miniprogram + WeUI design)、\
           桌面(desktop-design macOS/Windows)。按目标平台查对应标准，UI 遵循该端**官方设计规范**，注入的要落地、用到未注入的主动检索。\n\n\
         ## Design quality contract\n\n\
         Before writing ANY component, read `output/{slug}-uiux.md` and \
         lock these into your code:\n\
         1. **Typography first** — set the type scale in `:root` before \
            touching layout. Headings drive visual hierarchy.\n\
         2. **Whitespace is a feature** — generous padding/margin using \
            the spacing scale. No cramped layouts.\n\
         3. **Color from tokens only** — bind every `color`, \
            `background`, `border-color`, `box-shadow` to a CSS var. \
            Zero hardcoded hex/rgb/hsl.\n\
         4. **Real content** — use realistic placeholder text, not \
            \"Lorem ipsum\" or \"Example\". Names, dates, numbers that \
            feel authentic.\n\
         5. **Component states** — every interactive element must have \
            hover, active, focus, disabled styles. No state-less buttons.\n\
         6. **Dark mode** — if the UIUX doc defines dark tokens, wire \
            them via `prefers-color-scheme`.\n\
         7. **Responsive** — at minimum 2 breakpoints (mobile 360px, \
            desktop 1024px). Test both.\n\
         8. **Motion** — use the transition tokens from UIUX. Subtle \
            enter/exit animations on cards and modals.\n\n\
         ## Hard rules (will be audited)\n\n\
         - Icons from the declared library only. Zero emoji as icons.\n\
         - Every `fetch` URL MUST appear in `output/{slug}-architecture.md`.\n\
         - Run `npm run build` / `cargo check` — zero errors before submitting.\n\
         - Take a screenshot of the running app for the preview gate.\n\n\
         ## Anti-patterns to avoid (P0 cardinal sins)\n\n\
         - Purple/pink gradient hero sections\n\
         - Lorem ipsum / filler text\n\
         - \"Welcome to App\" generic headings\n\
         - Invented metrics without a source (\"10x faster\")\n\
         - Emoji used as functional icons\n\
         - Cards with identical placeholder text repeated 3x\n\
         - \"AI chatbot\" shell layout when the product is not a chatbot\n\
         - More than 2 accent-colored elements per viewport\n\
         - 3+ sections with identical layout (alternate the rhythm)\n\n\
         For the full P0/P1/P2 checklist, read \
         `knowledge/design-systems/00-craft-rules.md` if it exists.\n\n\
         Also check `knowledge/seed-templates/` for a matching page type \
         (saas-landing, dashboard, blog-content) — the seed template gives \
         you the section order and component patterns to follow.\n\n\
         ## Required output\n\n\
         - **Code:** actual runnable frontend files in project directory. NOT just a notes file.\n\
           Follow the file structure from `output/{slug}-architecture.md`.\n\
           Create real components, pages, layouts, API client.\n\
         - **Notes:** `output/{slug}-frontend-notes.md` with:\n\
           - ## Files created — list every file you wrote with purpose\n\
           - ## Architecture compliance — for each API endpoint in the architecture doc, \
             confirm frontend calls it correctly\n\
           - ## Design compliance — for each UIUX token, confirm it's used\n\
           - ## Test instructions — how to run and verify\n\
           - ## Known gaps — what's not implemented yet and why\n\n\
         ## Implementation checklist (follow in order)\n\n\
         1. Read execution plan → identify Sprint 1 tasks\n\
         2. Set up project scaffold (if not exists): `npx create-*` or equivalent\n\
         3. Copy design tokens from UIUX into CSS/theme file\n\
         4. Create shared components first (Button, Input, Card, Layout)\n\
         5. Create page components following page hierarchy from UIUX\n\
         6. Wire API client following architecture API surface\n\
         7. Add error handling (loading states, error states, empty states)\n\
         8. Test responsive (mobile + desktop)\n\
         9. Test dark mode\n\
         10. Run build — fix all errors\n\
         11. Write frontend-notes.md with compliance audit\n\n\
         ## Input\n\n\
         ### Requirement\n\n{req}\n\n\
         Read these in order:\n\
         1. `output/{slug}-uiux.md` — your PRIMARY visual guide. Every CSS var, \
            font choice, spacing value, and component pattern comes from here.\n\
         2. `output/{slug}-architecture.md` — API surface and tech stack.\n\
         3. `output/{slug}-prd.md` — acceptance criteria and user stories.\n\
         4. If `knowledge/design-systems/*.md` exists and the UIUX doc references \
            a design direction, read the matching file for detailed Do/Don't rules \
            and component patterns.\n\n\
         ## After you finish\n\n\
         Run the app, take a screenshot, ask the user to review. \
         They will approve via `umadev continue`.\n\
         {design_inject}",

fn render_backend(slug: &str, req: &str) -> String {
    format!(
        "## Role\n\nSenior backend engineer.\n\n\
         ## Task\n\nImplement the complete backend: API routes, database schema, \
         authentication, validation, error handling, and tests.\n\n\
         ## Implementation requirements\n\n\
         ### Structure FIRST (商业级分层，先定骨架再写实现)\n\
         - Build EXACTLY the feature modules + layers declared in the architecture doc's \
           `## Architecture & layering` section (package-by-feature: each module has its own \
           interface / application(service) / domain / infrastructure).\n\
         - Controller = parse→authorize→call service→map response ONLY (no business logic, \
           no direct DB/SQL/ORM).\n\
         - Service = stateless; one method = one use-case = one transaction boundary; \
           takes/returns DTOs, NEVER exposes ORM entities; orchestrates, depends on injected \
           repository/gateway interfaces.\n\
         - Domain entities hold business rules/invariants (NOT anemic — `order.cancel()` checks its own state).\n\
         - Repository ONLY persists (no business logic, does not commit transactions).\n\
         - Dependencies flow inward; inner layers depend on interfaces, not concrete infra.\n\n\
         ### 查阅工程标准库（重要）\n\
         - 本项目 `knowledge/backend/01-standards/` 等目录附带商业级工程标准。**识别本项目用到的方面，查对应标准照着做**：\
           auth(认证授权) / payment(支付) / file-upload / background-jobs / email / search / realtime / analytics / \
           llm-application(AI·RAG·Agent·护栏) / data-modeling / secure-coding(OWASP) / config-and-observability / \
           microservices / backend-framework-idioms(所选框架地道写法)。注入的相关标准要落地，未注入但用到的主动检索 knowledge/。\n\n\
         ### API routes\n\
         - Implement EVERY endpoint from `output/{slug}-architecture.md` API surface table\n\
         - Follow the error convention from the architecture doc\n\
         - Input validation on every endpoint (reject malformed requests with 422)\n\
         - Rate limiting on auth endpoints\n\n\
         ### Database\n\
         - Create migration files for the data model from architecture doc\n\
         - Add indexes listed in the architecture doc\n\
         - Seed data for development (realistic test fixtures)\n\n\
         ### Authentication\n\
         - Implement the auth method specified in architecture doc\n\
         - Protect routes according to the permission matrix\n\
         - Token refresh / session management\n\n\
         ### Error handling\n\
         - Consistent error response format across all endpoints\n\
         - Log errors with context (request ID, user ID, timestamp)\n\
         - Never expose internal errors to clients\n\n\
         ### Testing\n\
         - Unit tests for business logic\n\
         - Integration tests for each API endpoint\n\
         - Test happy path + error paths + edge cases\n\
         - Test auth: unauthorized access returns 401, forbidden returns 403\n\n\
         ## Required output\n\n\
         - **Code:** actual backend files (routes, models, middleware, tests)\n\
         - **Notes:** `output/{slug}-backend-notes.md` with:\n\
           - ## API compliance — for each architecture endpoint, confirm handler exists\n\
           - ## Database — migration files created, seed data\n\
           - ## Auth — implementation details\n\
           - ## Tests — test count, what's covered, what's not\n\
           - ## Environment variables — list every env var needed to run\n\
           - ## How to run — exact commands to start the backend\n\n\
         ## Input\n\n{req}\n\n\
         Read `output/{slug}-architecture.md` (API surface + data model + auth design) \
         and `output/{slug}-prd.md` (acceptance criteria to test against).\n",

         UmaDev runs the quality gate automatically. Review \
         `output/{slug}-quality-gate.md` and `output/{slug}-quality-gate.json`. \
         Fix anything flagged `failed` or `warning`.\n\n\
         ### Part 2 — Visual design critique (5 dimensions)\n\n\
         Open the running frontend and score it 1-10 on each dimension:\n\n\
         | Dimension | What to evaluate | Minimum |\n\
         |---|---|---|\n\
         | **Hierarchy** | Can a new user find the primary action in < 2 seconds? | 7 |\n\
         | **Distinctiveness** | Does it look like a custom design, not a template? | 7 |\n\
         | **Detail** | Hover states, focus rings, loading skeletons, empty states — all present? | 7 |\n\
         | **Function** | Every button works, every link navigates, every form validates? | 8 |\n\
         | **Polish** | Spacing consistent, type scale respected, dark mode works? | 7 |\n\n\
         If ANY dimension < minimum, go back to the frontend phase and fix it. \
         Append your scores to `output/{slug}-quality-gate.md`.\n\n\
         ## Required output\n\n\
         No new artifact — the gate report + your 5-dimension scores. Make sure \
         `quality_gate_passed: true` and all 5 dimensions ≥ minimum before delivery.\n",
