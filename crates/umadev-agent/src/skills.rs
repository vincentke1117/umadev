//! Reusable skill library — the success-compounding half of the self-evolution
//! loop, the positive mirror of the pitfall KB in [`crate::lessons`].
//!
//! A pitfall records "what bit us, avoid it next time". A SKILL records the
//! opposite: a verified, reusable capability — a diff, recipe, or contract
//! decision that already CLEARED the quality gate / contract cross-check /
//! build — distilled into `{ description, content }` so a later run can REUSE
//! the proven approach instead of re-deriving it.
//!
//! Until now a passing run only sedimented a one-line "validated pattern"
//! avoid-reminder ([`crate::lessons::LessonKind::ValidatedPattern`]); that is an
//! observation, not a reusable ability. This module upgrades it into a real
//! skill entry with a durable JSONL store, a graduation gate, top-k retrieval,
//! and utility-decay retirement.
//!
//! ## Graduation gate — the ONLY entry point
//! A skill is admitted ONLY when the producing run actually graduated:
//! - the artifact PASSED the quality gate / contract cross-check / build, AND
//! - it was a MULTI-STEP solve (the run needed revisions, quality fixes, or
//!   dev-error recoveries). A trivial one-pass result carries no reusable
//!   insight worth compounding, so it is NOT admitted.
//!
//! Both conditions are checked by [`graduate_skill`] off the existing delivery
//! capture point — no new pipeline phase.
//!
//! ## Retrieval — project-local and read-only
//! Each graduated skill is mirrored to `.umadev/learned/skills/` for the wider
//! knowledge surface, while causal skill reuse ranks the bounded project-local
//! store in memory with the shared mixed ASCII/CJK BM25 tokenizer. It never
//! opens another project's or the global learned corpus, writes an index cache,
//! calls an embedder, or mutates utility. [`retrieve_skills`] queries with the
//! *solution idea* (not the bare task) and returns the top-k skill hits.
//!
//! ## Attribution — retrieval is not reuse
//! Candidate retrieval is pure. A caller may commit a receipt only after the
//! exact content-bound skill block survived final prompt assembly and that
//! prompt was accepted by the host transport. A deterministic PASS / FAIL /
//! UNKNOWN verdict then settles the immutable receipt exactly once. Only PASS
//! raises utility, FAIL lowers it, and UNKNOWN records no preference.
//!
//! ## Retirement — utility decay + hard cap
//! Each store entry tracks a utility counter. A skill that was demonstrably
//! sent AND later validated is promoted; one that fails is demoted, and one
//! that goes long unused decays out of the top-k. Past the internal skill limit
//! the lowest-value entries are evicted.
//!
//! Every function here is fail-open: an I/O or parse error is a no-op (returns
//! empty / `false`), never blocking the base or the pipeline.
