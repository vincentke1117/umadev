//! Reusable skill library — the success-compounding half of the self-evolution
//! loop, the positive mirror of the pitfall KB in [`crate::lessons`].
//!
//! A pitfall records "what bit us, avoid it next time". A SKILL records the
//! opposite: a verified, reusable capability — a diff, recipe, or contract
//! decision that already CLEARED the quality gate / contract cross-check /
//! build — distilled into `{ description, content }` so a later run can REUSE
//! the proven approach instead of re-deriving it.
//!
//! Until now a passing run only sedimented a one-line "validated pattern"
//! avoid-reminder ([`crate::lessons::LessonKind::ValidatedPattern`]); that is an
//! observation, not a reusable ability. This module upgrades it into a real
//! skill entry with a durable JSONL store, a graduation gate, top-k retrieval,
//! and utility-decay retirement.
//!
//! ## Graduation gate — the ONLY entry point
//! A skill is admitted ONLY when the producing run actually graduated:
//! - the artifact PASSED the quality gate / contract cross-check / build, AND
//! - it was a MULTI-STEP solve (the run needed revisions, quality fixes, or
//!   dev-error recoveries). A trivial one-pass result carries no reusable
//!   insight worth compounding, so it is NOT admitted.
//!
//! Both conditions are checked by [`graduate_skill`] off the existing delivery
//! capture point — no new pipeline phase.
//!
//! ## Retrieval — reuse the curated BM25/vector path
//! Each graduated skill's content is mirrored to `.umadev/learned/skills/` as a
//! markdown file so the existing [`umadev_knowledge::retrieve`] index (BM25 by
//! default, vector when an embedding backend is reachable — both fail-open)
//! picks it up with zero new machinery. [`retrieve_skills`] queries that index
//! with the *solution idea* (not the bare task) and returns the top-k skill
//! hits.
//!
//! ## Retirement — utility decay + hard cap
//! Each store entry tracks a utility counter. A skill that is retrieved AND
//! still validates is promoted (utility++, recency refreshed); one that goes
//! long unmatched decays out of the top-k and, past [`MAX_SKILLS`], is evicted
//! lowest-utility-first — the same bounded-store discipline the pitfall KB uses.
//!
//! Every function here is fail-open: an I/O or parse error is a no-op (returns
//! empty / `false`), never blocking the base or the pipeline.
