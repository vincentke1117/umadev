//! Verify loop — the engine's "project-director Agent runs build/tests"
//! capability. After a code-producing phase, this module:
//!
//! 1. Detects what kind of project sits in the workspace
//!    (`deno.json` → Deno, `package.json` → Node, `Cargo.toml` → Rust,
//!    `go.mod` → Go, `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` → Python).
//!    For Node, the package manager (pnpm / yarn / bun / npm) is chosen
//!    from the lockfile so verify matches the scaffolded project.
//! 2. Runs a **sequence** of verify steps (install → lint → typecheck →
//!    test → build) for that project type as subprocesses, each with its
//!    own timeout and captured output. A step whose binary is missing
//!    (e.g. `ruff` not installed) is recorded as `skipped`, not failure.
//! 3. Returns a structured [`VerifyOutcome`] per step. The runner emits
//!    these as engine events and appends to `.umadev/audit/verify.jsonl`.
//!
//! This module **does not** retry on failure — it just reports. The
//! retry-with-feedback loop is layered on top in the runner.
//!
//! Failures are first-class data, not exceptions: an `Err` `VerifyOutcome`
//! is the desired path for "build failed, here's why". Spawn errors
//! produce a `passed: false` outcome with the OS error as `stderr`.
