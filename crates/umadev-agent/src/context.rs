//! Firmware composition — UmaDev's identity + 心法 + JIT knowledge + pitfall
//! memory, assembled into ONE token-budgeted system prompt the host drivers
//! inject over the base's system-prompt surface.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (Wave 2, L0)
//!
//! UmaDev is smart hardware; the base CLI is the brain. Until Wave 2 the
//! default path injected only a static team-identity directive — the base
//! never received our team's accumulated knowledge or this project's recorded
//! pitfalls, so "the firmware that justifies the product" was barely plugged
//! in. [`compose_firmware`] is that firmware: it composes WHO you are (the
//! senior-team-director identity + the seat the current step needs), HOW this
//! team builds (the compact anti-AI-slop craft law), WHAT we've learned that
//! applies right now (a small JIT knowledge digest), and WHAT bit us before (a
//! small pitfall-memory digest) — then hands it to the base through the
//! continuous session's system-prompt face.
//!
//! ## The five layers (priority high → low)
//!
//! 1. **Identity** — always-on, short: the director + the role the route's
//!    work needs. [`crate::experts::agentic_team_identity`] + a route-derived
//!    seat persona.
//! 2. **心法 / anti-slop** — the team's craft law
//!    ([`crate::experts::agentic_engineering_rules`]); surfaced for work-class
//!    turns, skipped for pure chat.
//! 3. **Repo-map slice (JIT, brownfield-aware)** — a token-budgeted,
//!    scope-personalised signature outline of the user's OWN code via
//!    [`umadev_knowledge::repo_map`], so the base understands the existing
//!    codebase ("explain this code", "fix the bug in checkout", "add a field"
//!    all become repo-aware). Injected only when the project is non-empty (a
//!    greenfield/blank repo emits nothing — no scan, no tokens) and the turn
//!    is work-class (anything but pure chat). Higher priority than the curated
//!    knowledge digest: on a brownfield repo, the user's real structure is a
//!    sharper signal than a generic standard.
//! 4. **Pitfall memory (JIT)** — high-signal recorded pitfalls that match the
//!    project's tech-stack fingerprint + the requirement, via
//!    [`crate::lessons::relevant_lessons_for_prompt`] (a small digest, not the
//!    ledger). Work-class only.
//! 5. **Knowledge (JIT)** — the few most-relevant curated knowledge chunks for
//!    the requirement, via [`crate::phases::agentic_knowledge_digest`] (a small
//!    top-K, not the whole corpus). Work-class only.
//!
//! ## Token economy
//!
//! The whole prompt is bounded by [`FIRMWARE_BUDGET`]. Layers are appended in
//! the priority order above and the FIRST layer that would overflow is
//! truncated (head-kept) so the highest-priority material always survives:
//! identity beats 心法 beats memory beats knowledge. A chat turn injects only
//! the (short) identity — no retrieval — so day-to-day conversation stays fast.
//!
//! ## Fail-open by contract (mirrors the governance kernel + the router)
//!
//! Every retrieval is best-effort: a missing `knowledge/` dir, a disabled KB, an
//! empty index, no matching lesson, an empty/unreadable repo (no repo-map) — each
//! yields an empty layer, never an error. In the limit (everything fails) the
//! result is just the always-on identity, which is exactly the pre-Wave-2
//! behaviour. This function NEVER returns an error and NEVER blocks the base.
