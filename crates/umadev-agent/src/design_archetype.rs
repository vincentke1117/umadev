//! **Which design archetype fits THIS product?** — the one question, asked of the brain.
//!
//! UmaDev's design system is ON BY DEFAULT: even when the base's UIUX doc declares no
//! visual direction, the frontend still gets a binding token contract, so *some* archetype
//! (premium-luxury / brutalist-bold / glass-aurora / soft-warm / editorial-clean / …) has to
//! be chosen. That choice is a DESIGNER'S JUDGMENT about the product's domain, audience, and
//! the tone it must project.
//!
//! It used to be a keyword classifier — a product-type inference engine that scanned the
//! requirement against hardcoded trigger lists (`fashion`/`portfolio` → brutalist,
//! `wealth`/`watch` → luxury, and so on). That is the wrong shape of answer, for the same
//! reason a lexical color-permission reader was: a product's character has unboundedly many
//! phrasings, and the next requirement is always outside the list. "a calm space for grief
//! journaling" chooses no keyword yet clearly wants soft-warm; "the terminal for your money"
//! reads as tech-utility to a designer and as `payment`→bold-geometric to a `contains()`.
//! **A word list is the wrong shape of answer.**
//!
//! ## The project's standing rule: judgment is the brain's, not a table's
//!
//! UmaDev does not classify intent with keywords — [`crate::router::route_via_brain`] asks
//! the base's own model whether a turn is chat / edit / build, and
//! [`crate::color_permission`] asks it whether the requirement authorized a flagged hue.
//! *"Which archetype fits this product?"* is the same class of question, and it gets the same
//! answer: **one stateless, structured consult → a typed [`DesignArchetype`]**, an id drawn
//! from the fixed, known archetype set. No product-type inference engine, and nothing that
//! grows.
//!
//! Only the *choice of archetype* moves to the brain. The design tokens, the archetype
//! knowledge packs, and the anti-AI-slop token conformance downstream are UmaDev's core value
//! and are untouched: this module changes only HOW the archetype is picked, never what the
//! picked archetype then binds.
//!
//! ## Fail direction: fall back to the SAME deterministic default, never crash
//!
//! Unlike the color floor, an undetermined archetype is NOT a safety stand-down — it is a
//! missing recommendation. So the strict direction here is the CONSERVATIVE DEFAULT the code
//! already used: brain unreachable, offline runtime, fork refused, prose instead of JSON, a
//! timeout, or an id outside the known set → [`DesignArchetype::undetermined`], which persists
//! nothing, and the sync coach renderer falls back to the deterministic keyword recommendation
//! (`coach::recommend_design_system`, now kept ONLY as that fail-fallback). The
//! pipeline is never blocked and nothing ever crashes.
//!
//! ## Computed ONCE at the run door, persisted, read by the sync renderer
//!
//! The consult runs at the run door where the phase-walk pipeline persists its governance
//! context ([`crate::continuous::run_block`], which both the legacy pipeline and the
//! `AgentRunner` continuous path funnel through) — the same door where the colour question is
//! asked, the instant the requirement is known. The chosen id is written into
//! `.umadev/design-archetype.json`, stamped with the requirement it was derived from. (The
//! director-loop `/run` engine never renders per-phase design injection, so it neither needs
//! nor asks the archetype question — only the colour question, which every code-writing path
//! must persist for the write governor.) The archetype is *resolved* in
//! `coach::load_design_system_inject`, a synchronous prompt renderer with no brain of
//! its own; it READS the stored pick as its fallback (after an explicit `/design` and after the
//! UIUX doc's own declared direction, both of which still win). One consult, one writer, one
//! reader.
//!
//! The stored pick is honoured only for the SAME requirement it was derived from
//! (provenance-gated by [`umadev_governance::requirement_fingerprint`]): a different
//! requirement — or an unstamped / unreadable / absent file — carries nothing forward and the
//! renderer falls back to the deterministic recommendation.
