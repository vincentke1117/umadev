//! Director team capabilities — the internal Rust levers UmaDev calls during its
//! own QC pass (the USB / smart-hardware model of
//! `docs/AGENT_WIELDS_BASE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, simplified: NO marker protocol).
//!
//! UmaDev never asks the base to speak a scheduling protocol to "summon a team" from
//! the outside — there is NO base-emitted lever syntax. Instead these four functions
//! are **UmaDev's OWN internal Rust capabilities**, and [`crate::director_loop`]
//! invokes them in one of two build modes, chosen AUTOMATICALLY from the router's
//! depth signal (Wave A):
//!
//! - **Deliberate build** → UmaDev's own loop drives the plan SEAT-BY-SEAT
//!   ([`crate::director_loop::drive_plan_steps`]): it [`summon`]s each step's seat
//!   serially on the main session (single-writer) so the team visibly BUILDS its own
//!   deliverables, then [`review`]s / [`verify`]s to judge reality.
//! - **Lean / single-turn build** → the base is already a complete Agent: its body
//!   builds the goal end to end with the team living inside its own head, steered by
//!   UmaDev's injected firmware (identity + craft + knowledge), and these functions
//!   are called AFTER it builds to read reality and judge it.
//!
//! - [`summon`] — drive/fork ONE seat. On a DELIBERATE build the director's build loop
//!   ([`crate::director_loop::drive_plan_steps`]) drives EACH plan step by `summon`ing
//!   its seat in [`SummonMode::Serial`] on the main session (single-writer) — the
//!   seat-by-seat "team builds" path (Wave A). On a lean / single-turn build the base
//!   builds end to end in one turn and the lever is used only for QC composition + any
//!   caller that wants a single-seat round-trip.
//! - [`review`] — fork the cross-review team on read-only sessions and collect
//!   verdicts (UmaDev's QC, NOT the base summoning anyone).
//! - [`verify`] — read an objective reality fact (source-present / build-test /
//!   contract) deterministically; never an opinion.
//! - [`checkpoint`] — pause for the user when the decision is theirs (trust-tiered).
//!
//! Crucially these are **not advertised to the base as levers it must learn** — the
//! marker/lever PROMPT surface is retired. They are pure Rust UmaDev calls. A
//! trivial goal needs none; a real product's QC calls [`verify`] + [`review`] and
//! feeds blocking findings back as a fix directive the base's body acts on.
//!
//! Everything here is a **thin wrapper over machinery that already exists** — it
//! reuses, never reimplements:
//!
//! - [`summon`] in [`SummonMode::Serial`] drives the MAIN session through the same
//!   governed, single-writer turn pump the rework loop uses
//!   ([`continuous::drive_rework_turn`]); in [`SummonMode::Parallel`] it forks a
//!   read-only session ([`continuous::fork_with_timeout`]) and reviews/works on it
//!   ([`continuous::ForkConsult`]) — exactly `critics.rs`'s mechanism, generalised
//!   so the director can invoke it whenever it judges useful.
//! - [`review`] reuses [`continuous::run_review_team`] + [`continuous::team_for`]
//!   (the 8-seat critic roster, scaled to the task) to fork parallel reviewers and
//!   collect their [`RoleVerdict`]s.
//! - [`verify`] reuses the objective checkers — [`crate::verify::run_verify`] (real
//!   build/test/lint), [`continuous::quality_floor`] (contract + coverage drift),
//!   and [`crate::acceptance::source_files`] (real code present) — and returns a FACTUAL
//!   result, never an opinion.
//! - [`checkpoint`] reuses the trust ladder ([`crate::trust::TrustMode`]): in `auto` it
//!   auto-proceeds, in `guarded` / `plan` it genuinely pauses for the user.
//!
//! HARD INVARIANTS (mirrors `critics.rs`; never break — these keep the team SAFE):
//!
//! 1. **Fail-open.** Every tool degrades to a safe no-op on any error: a summon
//!    that can't drive returns "not done" (the director proceeds), a review that
//!    can't fork returns no blocking (accept), a verify that can't run returns
//!    "unavailable / skipped" (not a false failure), a checkpoint that can't reach
//!    the user auto-proceeds. A tool can NEVER block the director on a bug.
//! 2. **Single-writer preserved.** Only [`SummonMode::Serial`] mutates the
//!    workspace, and it does so on the MAIN session under the run-lock the caller
//!    already holds — exactly one doer writes at a time. Parallel summons + every
//!    review run on ISOLATED read-only forks that never touch the main writer.
//! 3. **Objective floor untouched.** [`verify`] is a deterministic reality check
//!    (it RUNS the build / greps the real source); critic verdicts from [`review`]
//!    stay advisory — they fold into a rework directive but never drive loop
//!    termination, which the deterministic floor + the user gate own.
//! 4. **No new endpoint.** Every tool runs over the SAME borrowed brain (the live
//!    [`BaseSession`] + its `fork()`); no extra model endpoint, no extra API key.
//!
//! ## Why no base-facing lever protocol
//!
//! An earlier design exposed these as a marker protocol the base emitted
//! (`<<<umadev:summon …>>>`) that UmaDev parsed and mediated. That is retired: the
//! base is already a whole brain that builds multi-role code internally once the
//! firmware is injected, so making it speak a scheduling protocol to summon a team
//! from the outside was over-design. These functions remain ONLY as UmaDev's own
//! internal Rust calls (used by [`crate::director_loop`] to drive a deliberate build
//! seat-by-seat and to run its QC pass); the base never learns or emits a lever syntax.
