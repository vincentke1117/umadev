//! Runtime proof — the engine's "does the app actually RUN?" capability.
//!
//! Plain [`verify`](crate::verify) proves the project *compiles and its tests
//! pass*. That is necessary but not sufficient evidence of a working delivery:
//! a build can be green while the app fails to boot, the dev server crashes on
//! start, or the documented routes 500. This module closes that gap by
//! producing **runtime evidence** — it boots the detected dev server, waits for
//! it to answer, and probes the real routes over HTTP.
//!
//! The flow (all fail-open — any failure degrades to a recorded reason, never a
//! panic or a blocked host):
//!
//! 1. **Detect** the dev-server command via
//!    [`crate::verify::detect_dev_server`] (Vite / Next / Astro / CRA / generic
//!    `dev` script / static-file server).
//! 2. **Reclaim our own leftover**: a dev server this tool spawned on a previous
//!    run and recorded in `.umadev/preview.pid` is killed before booting again,
//!    so it can't keep holding the port. This is CONSERVATIVE — only a PID we
//!    ourselves tracked is ever killed; a foreign process is never touched.
//! 3. **Reuse-or-spawn**: if a server already answers the expected URL after the
//!    reclaim, it is a foreign holder — reuse it (probe it directly, no duplicate
//!    spawn). Otherwise spawn the dev command with its **stdout/stderr piped**.
//! 4. **Bounded boot**: read the child's output for readiness *and* conflict
//!    signals ("Port X in use, using available port Y", "already running",
//!    `EADDRINUSE`) while polling `curl`, all inside one timeout. A port fallback
//!    re-points the probe at the actual bound port; a never-binding boot stops
//!    with a typed diagnosis instead of hanging. Exactly one spawn — never a
//!    re-run loop. `curl` is used deliberately: near-universal, no new dep.
//! 5. **Probe routes**: read `.umadev/contracts/openapi.json` (written by the
//!    contract/adopt stage) and `curl` each documented path, recording
//!    `{path, status, ms}`. With no contract, at least the root path is probed.
//! 6. **Optional e2e**: if a Playwright/Cypress config or a `test:e2e` script is
//!    present, run it once and capture the outcome.
//! 7. **Tear down**: the child is killed (`kill_on_drop` plus an eager kill) and
//!    the pidfile cleared, so this preview server can never become the next
//!    run's leftover.
//!
//! The structured [`RuntimeProof`] is serialized to
//! `.umadev/audit/runtime-proof.json` and folded into the delivery proof-pack
//! (see `phases::build_and_zip_proof_pack`). User-facing prose lives in the
//! binary (which owns the i18n catalog); this crate stays dependency-light and
//! emits machine-readable data plus a neutral one-line summary.
