//! Intelligent intent router (Wave 1, L1) — UmaDev's "thinking" primitive.
//!
//! The router is UmaDev borrowing the base's brain to DECIDE *how* to handle a
//! turn, before any work begins. It produces one typed [`RoutePlan`] the caller
//! reads to choose a path (fast / deliberate / clarify), size the team, and budget
//! the turn. It performs NO work itself and owns NO model — it consults the borrowed
//! brain over a read-only fork, exactly like the proven critic / intake patterns.
//!
//! ## The chat surface: the BRAIN judges intent ([`route_via_brain`])
//!
//! UmaDev depends on the base ecosystem — the base's own model IS the brain. So the
//! default chat surface routes a turn by ASKING THE BRAIN, not a keyword table:
//! [`route_via_brain`] runs one stateless `complete()` triage (`claude --print` and
//! equivalents — no fork, no session) and the brain decides
//! chat / explain / quick_edit / debug / build. A model judges "你能帮我做什么?" is a
//! greeting and "把标题改成 X" is a tweak far better than any word list could. There
//! is **no deterministic keyword classifier** on this path by design: if the brain
//! is unreachable the product can't run anyway, so a failed / garbage consult
//! degrades to the lightest path ([`RouteClass::Chat`], pass-through to the base),
//! never a keyword guess.
//!
//! ## The deterministic helpers (sizing + the explicit-run path)
//!
//! [`classify`] + [`looks_like_work_request`] + the fork-based [`route`] / [`reconcile`]
//! still exist to SIZE a build (kind / depth / team) and serve the explicit `/run`
//! path ([`for_run`], which already KNOWS the intent is a build). They are not the
//! chat surface's intent judge — the brain is.
//!
//! ## Invariants (mirror `critics.rs` / `director.rs`)
//!
//! 1. **Fail-open.** `session == None`, an offline brain, a fork that won't open, a
//!    consult that times out / returns garbage — every one of these degrades to the
//!    pure Tier-0 result. The router can NEVER block the host or return an error.
//! 2. **No new endpoint.** The Tier-1 consult runs over the SAME borrowed brain +
//!    its `fork()`; no extra model, no API key.
//! 3. **Read-only.** The consult runs on an isolated read-only fork that never
//!    touches the main writer session (single-writer preserved).
//! 4. **Observational.** Producing a [`RoutePlan`] changes nothing on disk; the
//!    caller decides what to do with it.

const ROUTER_TRIAGE_SYSTEM: &str =
    "You are a senior engineering director triaging ONE incoming request before \
     any work starts. Decide how to handle it. Be decisive and terse. \
     `class`: chat (small talk / a greeting / a question about you) | explain (read-only \
     Q&A about code) | quick_edit (a small, well-scoped change to existing text/code) | \
     debug (diagnose+fix a defect) | build (create a real feature/product). A greeting or \
     a 'what can you do' question is chat, NOT build, even if it mentions building. \
     Conversely, a request to implement a WHOLE project / product / app — especially \
     one that points at a requirements / spec / PRD / 需求 / design document (e.g. \
     'build what's in docs/spec.md', '实现 docs 里的需求', 'do this project') — is \
     `build` with `kind:greenfield`, NEVER `quick_edit`, even if phrased tersely or as \
     just a file path: delivering a product from a spec is real, multi-part work. \
     Reserve `quick_edit` for a SMALL, single-surface change to something that already \
     exists. \
     Distinct from BOTH of the above: a request to WRITE / PRODUCE a DOCUMENT as the \
     deliverable ITSELF — a PRD, a spec, a design doc, a technical proposal, a research \
     / status report, a 需求文档 / 技术方案 / 设计文档 / 调研报告 / 周报 — is \
     `kind:docs_only` with `complexity:simple`: the output is a written document, NOT a \
     built product, so it wants ONE editorial pass (does it serve the requirement, is it \
     coherent and complete), never a full delivery team or a source-code build. This is \
     the OPPOSITE of 'build the product DESCRIBED IN a document' above — WRITING the spec \
     is a light `docs_only` task; IMPLEMENTING what the spec describes is \
     `build`/`greenfield`. Do not size a document up to a product just because it is \
     long or detailed. \
     `kind`: greenfield | frontend_only | backend_only | bugfix | refactor | docs_only | \
     light. `complexity`: simple | medium | complex. Only set `clarify_question` when the \
     request is genuinely ambiguous in a way you could NOT resolve by reading the code — \
     never ask what you can discover yourself. JSON shape: \
     {\"class\":\"…\",\"kind\":\"…\",\"complexity\":\"simple|medium|complex\",\
     \"needs\":[\"…\"],\"scope\":[\"file/dir\",…],\"risks\":[\"…\"],\
     \"clarify_question\":\"\",\"clarify_options\":[],\"confidence\":0.0}";
