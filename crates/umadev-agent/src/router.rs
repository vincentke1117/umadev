//! Intelligent intent router (Wave 1, L1) — UmaDev's "thinking" primitive.
//!
//! The router is UmaDev borrowing the base's brain to DECIDE *how* to handle a
//! turn, before any work begins. It produces one typed [`RoutePlan`] the caller
//! reads to choose a path (fast / deliberate / clarify), size the team, and budget
//! the turn. It performs NO work itself and owns NO model — it consults the borrowed
//! brain over a read-only fork, exactly like the proven critic / intake patterns.
//!
//! ## The chat surface: the BRAIN judges intent
//!
//! UmaDev depends on the base ecosystem — the base's own model IS the brain. So the
//! resident chat surface asks that SAME model on a read-only fork *before* the
//! writer acts. The brain decides chat / explain / quick_edit / debug / build. A
//! model judges "你能帮我做什么?" is a greeting and "把标题改成 X" is a tweak far
//! better than any word list could. [`deterministic_route`] is only the fail-open
//! fallback when the fork or typed reply is unavailable.
//!
//! ## The deterministic helpers (sizing + the explicit-run path)
//!
//! [`classify`] + [`looks_like_work_request`] still exist to SIZE a build (kind /
//! depth / team), serve the explicit `/run` path ([`for_run`], which already KNOWS
//! the intent is a build), and provide a conservative availability fallback. They
//! are not the healthy chat surface's intent judge — the brain is.
//!
//! ## Invariants (mirror `critics.rs` / `director.rs`)
//!
//! 1. **Fail-open.** `session == None`, an offline brain, a fork that won't open, a
//!    consult that times out / returns garbage — every one of these degrades to a
//!    conservative deterministic result. The router can NEVER block the host or
//!    return an error.
//! 2. **No new endpoint.** The Tier-1 consult runs over the SAME borrowed brain +
//!    its `fork()`; no extra model, no API key.
//! 3. **Read-only.** The consult runs on an isolated read-only fork that never
//!    touches the main writer session (single-writer preserved).
//! 4. **Observational.** Producing a [`RoutePlan`] changes nothing on disk; the
//!    caller decides what to do with it.

const ROUTER_TRIAGE_SYSTEM: &str =
    "You are a senior engineering director triaging ONE incoming request before \
     any work starts. Judge the COMPLETE request semantically, including negation \
     and whether the user asks about past work; never route from one keyword. Be \
     decisive and terse. ONLY the text inside the final `Request:` block is the \
     current-turn authority. Inherited conversation, project instructions, plans, \
     TODOs, run notes, specifications, and remembered work are context only: never \
     resume or execute them unless the `Request:` block explicitly asks you to. \
     `class`: chat (small talk / a greeting / a question about you) | explain (read-only \
     Q&A about code) | quick_edit (a small, well-scoped change to existing text/code) | \
     debug (diagnose+fix a defect) | build (create a real feature/product). A greeting or \
     a 'what can you do' question is chat, NOT build, even if it mentions building. \
     A request to explain, inspect, summarize what changed, report progress, or \
     analyze something WITHOUT edits is `explain`, never a mutating class. Explicit \
     constraints such as '不要修改', '只分析', 'read-only', or 'do not change files' \
     are binding. \
     Conversely, a request to implement a WHOLE project / product / app — especially \
     one that points at a requirements / spec / PRD / 需求 / design document (e.g. \
     'build what's in docs/spec.md', '实现 docs 里的需求', 'do this project') — is \
     `build` with `kind:greenfield`, NEVER `quick_edit`, even if phrased tersely or as \
     just a file path: delivering a product from a spec is real, multi-part work. \
     Reserve `quick_edit` for a SMALL, single-surface change to something that already \
     exists. \
     Distinct from BOTH of the above: a request to WRITE / PRODUCE a DOCUMENT as the \
     deliverable ITSELF — a PRD, a spec, a design doc, a technical proposal, a research \
     / status report, a 需求文档 / 技术方案 / 设计文档 / 调研报告 / 周报 — is \
     `class:quick_edit`, `kind:docs_only`, `complexity:simple`: the output is a written \
     document, NOT a built product, so it wants ONE editorial pass (does it serve the \
     requirement, is it coherent and complete), never a full delivery team or a \
     source-code build. This is \
     the OPPOSITE of 'build the product DESCRIBED IN a document' above — WRITING the spec \
     is a light `docs_only` task; IMPLEMENTING what the spec describes is \
     `build`/`greenfield`. Do not size a document up to a product just because it is \
     long or detailed. \
     `authorization`: read_only when the request asks only for conversation, explanation, \
     inspection, analysis, status, a summary, or a clarification; mutating only when the \
     request actually authorizes changing the workspace. Always emit this field; a missing or \
     invalid value cannot authorize mutation. A phrase quoted as text, negated \
     (for example '不要只分析'), or scoped to 'other files' is not a blanket read-only \
     instruction. `kind`: greenfield | frontend_only | backend_only | bugfix | refactor | \
     docs_only | light. `complexity`: simple | medium | complex. Only set \
     `clarify_question` when the \
     request is genuinely ambiguous in a way you could NOT resolve by reading the code — \
     never ask what you can discover yourself. JSON shape: \
     {\"class\":\"…\",\"authorization\":\"read_only|mutating\",\"kind\":\"…\",\"complexity\":\"simple|medium|complex\",\
     \"needs\":[\"…\"],\"scope\":[\"workspace/relative/file-or-dir\",…],\"risks\":[\"…\"],\
