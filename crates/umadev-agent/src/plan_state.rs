//! Owned, visible plan (Wave 1, L2) — UmaDev's "planning" primitive.
//!
//! Today the plan lives invisibly in the base's head and the phase bar sits frozen.
//! This module gives UmaDev a [`Plan`] data structure it OWNS: a dependency DAG of
//! [`PlanStep`]s, each with a machine-checkable [`AcceptanceSpec`] (so "done" is a
//! deterministic fact, not vibes), persisted to `.umadev/plan.json` and surfaced as
//! live events. The plan is SYNTHESISED by borrowing the base's brain for one forked
//! strict-JSON turn (cloned from the proven intake / critic consult pattern) — UmaDev
//! owns no model and performs no cognition itself.
//!
//! ## Wave 1 scope
//!
//! This wave **synthesises, persists, and displays** the plan; it does NOT yet drive
//! the build step-by-step off it (the existing director build loop still executes,
//! emitting progress events). Driving the plan via `summon` is Wave 2. Keeping the
//! scope here narrow is deliberate.
//!
//! ## Invariants (mirror `router.rs` / `critics.rs`)
//!
//! 1. **Fail-open.** [`synthesize_plan`] returns `None` on any failure (offline /
//!    no fork / timeout / unparseable) — the caller falls back to today's
//!    single-turn behaviour. Persistence is best-effort; a failed write is logged-
//!    nowhere and ignored, never an error that blocks the host.
//! 2. **No new endpoint.** The planning consult runs over the SAME borrowed brain +
//!    its `fork()`; no extra model, no API key.
//! 3. **Read-only synthesis.** The planning turn runs on an isolated read-only fork;
//!    it never touches the main writer session.
//! 4. **UmaDev owns the artifact.** The parsed [`Plan`] is UmaDev's typed data — the
//!    base produced JSON, UmaDev validated + normalised + owns it.
