//! Owned, visible plan (Wave 1, L2) — UmaDev's "planning" primitive.
//!
//! Today the plan lives invisibly in the base's head and the phase bar sits frozen.
//! This module gives UmaDev a [`Plan`] data structure it OWNS: a dependency DAG of
//! [`PlanStep`]s, each with a machine-checkable [`AcceptanceSpec`] (so "done" is a
//! deterministic fact, not vibes), persisted to `.umadev/plan.json` and surfaced as
//! live events. The plan is SYNTHESISED by borrowing the base's brain for one forked
//! strict-JSON turn (cloned from the proven intake / critic consult pattern) — UmaDev
//! owns no model and performs no cognition itself.
//!
//! ## Wave 1 scope
//!
//! This wave **synthesises, persists, and displays** the plan; it does NOT yet drive
//! the build step-by-step off it (the existing director build loop still executes,
//! emitting progress events). Driving the plan via `summon` is Wave 2. Keeping the
//! scope here narrow is deliberate.
//!
//! ## Invariants (mirror `router.rs` / `critics.rs`)
//!
//! 1. **Fail-open.** [`synthesize_plan`] returns `None` on any failure (offline /
//!    no fork / timeout / unparseable) — the caller falls back to today's
//!    single-turn behaviour. Persistence is best-effort; a failed write is logged-
//!    nowhere and ignored, never an error that blocks the host.
//! 2. **No new endpoint.** The planning consult runs over the SAME borrowed brain +
//!    its `fork()`; no extra model, no API key.
//! 3. **Read-only synthesis.** The planning turn runs on an isolated read-only fork;
//!    it never touches the main writer session.
//! 4. **UmaDev owns the artifact.** The parsed [`Plan`] is UmaDev's typed data — the
//!    base produced JSON, UmaDev validated + normalised + owns it.

         seat, whether it BUILDS or REVIEWS, its dependencies (by step id), and a MECHANICAL \
         acceptance criterion UmaDev can check deterministically. \
         Routing context — class={class}, kind={kind}, depth={depth}, team=[{team_line}]. \
         Keep the plan proportional to that depth. \
         `seat`: one of product-manager, architect, uiux-designer, frontend-engineer, \
         backend-engineer, qa-engineer, security-engineer, devops-engineer. \
         `kind`: build | review. \
         `acceptance`: source-present | build-test | contract | design-tokens | review-clean. \
         `evidence` (OPTIONAL but STRONGLY preferred): an array declaring the SPECIFIC, \
         machine-checkable proof this step is done — UmaDev verifies it deterministically \
         before marking the step done, so make `done` falsifiable. Each entry is an object \
         {{\"kind\":…, …}}; kinds: \
         {{\"kind\":\"file-exists\",\"path\":\"src/foo.tsx\"}}, \
         {{\"kind\":\"file-contains\",\"path\":\"src/api.ts\",\"needle\":\"/api/login\"}}, \

         {{\"kind\":\"contract-matches\"}}, {{\"kind\":\"source-present\"}}, \
         {{\"kind\":\"test-fails-then-passes\",\"test\":\"login_rejects_bad_password\"}}. \
         Prefer the most \
         specific evidence the step actually produces (a concrete file/route over a generic \
         build-clean). \
         `test-fails-then-passes` is the strongest bar available and the right one for an \
         IMPLEMENTATION step that makes a previously-authored test go green: UmaDev rewinds \
         to the step's pre-state, runs THAT ONE named test (it must FAIL there), restores \
         head, and runs it again (it must PASS). Name a test that genuinely could not have \
         passed before this step. Never put it on the step that AUTHORS the test — an \
         authored test is expected to be red until the code lands. \
         `files` (REQUIRED for EVERY build step): the step's complete file surface, \
         {{\"create\":[\"src/api/login.ts\"],\"modify\":[\"src/routes.ts\"]}} — the paths this \
         step will bring into existence or edit (a trailing `/` claims a whole directory). \
         UmaDev holds the working tree against the UNION of every step's surface: a NEW \
         source file, dependency, public route, OR edit that NO step claimed is \
         out-of-scope work and blocks. A build step with no file surface cannot start. \
         Declare every file/directory the step may write; if a change is genuinely needed, \
         it belongs in some step's surface. Never use a repository-wide catch-all such as \
         `.` or `/`; keep the surface proportional to this requirement. \
         Team-deliverable rules (UmaDev enforces ALL of these STRUCTURALLY after parsing — \
         a missing tokens/QA step is inserted and the ordering edges are wired — so a plan \
         that already honours them survives normalisation unchanged): \
         (a) when there is a UI surface, the uiux-designer has a BUILD step that writes the \
         design system as real `design-tokens.{{json,css}}` files (acceptance=design-tokens) \
         and every frontend step depends_on it; \
         (b) the architect's API contract is a depends_on PREREQUISITE of every \
         frontend/backend step (lock the interface first); \
         (c) QA AUTHORS tests as its OWN build step BEFORE the code steps (seat=qa-engineer, \
         kind=build, acceptance=source-present, evidence=file-exists on the test dir/files — \
         authored tests are EXPECTED to fail until the code lands, so never gate this step \
         on a green suite) that does NOT depend on the frontend/backend code steps, while \
         every frontend/backend step depends_on it — the test-author must not be the \
