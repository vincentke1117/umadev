//! Owned, visible plan (Wave 1, L2) — UmaDev's "planning" primitive.
//!
//! Today the plan lives invisibly in the base's head and the phase bar sits frozen.
//! This module gives UmaDev a [`Plan`] data structure it OWNS: a dependency DAG of
//! [`PlanStep`]s, each with a machine-checkable [`AcceptanceSpec`] (so "done" is a
//! deterministic fact, not vibes), persisted to `.umadev/plan.json` and surfaced as
//! live events. The plan is SYNTHESISED by borrowing the base's brain for one forked
//! strict-JSON turn (cloned from the proven intake / critic consult pattern) — UmaDev
//! owns no model and performs no cognition itself.
//!
//! ## Wave 1 scope
//!
//! This wave **synthesises, persists, and displays** the plan; it does NOT yet drive
//! the build step-by-step off it (the existing director build loop still executes,
//! emitting progress events). Driving the plan via `summon` is Wave 2. Keeping the
//! scope here narrow is deliberate.
//!
//! ## Invariants (mirror `router.rs` / `critics.rs`)
//!
//! 1. **Fail-open.** [`synthesize_plan`] returns `None` on any failure (offline /
//!    no fork / timeout / unparseable) — the caller falls back to today's
//!    single-turn behaviour. Persistence is best-effort; a failed write is logged-
//!    nowhere and ignored, never an error that blocks the host.
//! 2. **No new endpoint.** The planning consult runs over the SAME borrowed brain +
//!    its `fork()`; no extra model, no API key.
//! 3. **Read-only synthesis.** The planning turn runs on an isolated read-only fork;
//!    it never touches the main writer session.
//! 4. **UmaDev owns the artifact.** The parsed [`Plan`] is UmaDev's typed data — the
//!    base produced JSON, UmaDev validated + normalised + owns it.

         seat, whether it BUILDS or REVIEWS, its dependencies (by step id), and a MECHANICAL \
         acceptance criterion UmaDev can check deterministically. \
         Routing context — class={class}, kind={kind}, depth={depth}, team=[{team_line}]. \
         Keep the plan proportional to that depth. \
         `seat`: one of product-manager, architect, uiux-designer, frontend-engineer, \
         backend-engineer, qa-engineer, security-engineer, devops-engineer. \
         `kind`: build | review. \
         `acceptance`: source-present | build-test | contract | design-tokens | review-clean. \
         `evidence` (OPTIONAL but STRONGLY preferred): an array declaring the SPECIFIC, \
         machine-checkable proof this step is done — UmaDev verifies it deterministically \
         before marking the step done, so make `done` falsifiable. Each entry is an object \

         Team-deliverable rules (UmaDev ALSO enforces these structurally, so honour them): \
         (a) when there is a UI surface, the uiux-designer has a BUILD step that writes the \
         design system as real `design-tokens.{{json,css}}` files (acceptance=design-tokens) \
         and every frontend step depends_on it; \
         (b) the architect's API contract is a depends_on PREREQUISITE of every \
         frontend/backend step (lock the interface first); \
         (c) QA AUTHORS tests as its OWN build step (seat=qa-engineer, kind=build, \
         acceptance=build-test) that does NOT depend on the frontend/backend code steps — \
         the test-author must not be the code-author (de-biasing); a QA review step is \
