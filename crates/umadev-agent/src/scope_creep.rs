//! Scope-creep detection — the DUAL of requirement coverage.
//!
//! [`crate::coverage`] answers one half of "does the delivery match the plan?": *which
//! declared requirement has no task?* That catches UNDER-building — work that was
//! promised and quietly dropped.
//!
//! This module answers the other half: *which CHANGE belongs to no step?* That catches
//! OVER-building — work that was never planned, never sized, never reviewed, and that
//! nobody asked for. It is the more insidious direction, because over-building looks
//! like productivity: an unplanned dependency pulled in to save ten minutes, an
//! unplanned source file that becomes a second way to do the same thing, an unplanned
//! public route that becomes an unowned piece of attack surface. None of those show up
//! as a failing test. They show up months later.
//!
//! The check is a set difference, and it only exists because the plan is a machine-
//! readable artifact UmaDev owns: every step declares its file surface
//! ([`crate::plan_state::StepFiles`]), so the UNION of those surfaces is the set of
//! places the run said it would write. Diff that against the set of places it actually
//! wrote (the shadow-repo run diff — the same changed-file source the rest of the
//! deterministic floor reads) and what remains is, by construction, unclaimed.
//!
//! ## Severity follows blast radius, not line count
//! - **BLOCKING** — an unclaimed change that creates a NEW SURFACE, i.e. something that
//!   did not exist before and that the rest of the system (or the outside world) can
//!   now depend on:
//!   - a new **source file** (a new place for logic to live),
//!   - a new **dependency** in a MANIFEST — the file that carries the decision (new
//!     code you did not write, and a new supply chain). Never a lockfile: that is the
//!     resolver's transitive output, so one planned install would read as a hundred
//!     unclaimed dependencies (using the internal lockfile list),
//!   - a new **public route** (new attack surface, new contract).
//! - **BLOCKING** — an unclaimed EDIT to an existing file as well. A requested SEO
//!   change that quietly edits auth, build, or unrelated UI code is still out of
//!   scope even though it created no new file. Execution contracts make incidental
//!   wiring explicit in the responsible step instead of treating drift as harmless.
//!
//! ## Fail-open (the repo's hard rule)
//! A missing run diff/baseline remains fail-open because there is no evidence to
//! judge. A missing `files` declaration is different: it is a known malformed
//! execution contract, reported as a blocking preflight finding before mutation.
