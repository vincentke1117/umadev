//! Advisory single-writer lock per workspace.
//!
//! Two concurrent `umadev` runs in the same workspace (e.g. the chat TUI plus a
//! scripted `umadev continue` in another terminal) share `workflow-state.json`,
//! `output/*`, and the provider config — running them at once silently corrupts
//! ordering and clobbers artifacts. This is the same hazard Terraform guards
//! with state locking and Git with `index.lock`.
//!
//! The ownership primitive is a kernel advisory lock held on the persistent
//! `.umadev/run.lock.guard` file. `.umadev/run.owner` is diagnostic owner
//! metadata; `.umadev/run.lock` is a permanent v2 compatibility fence that
//! makes older create-new clients fail closed. The kernel releases ownership on
//! drop or process death, so crash recovery never needs a racy
//! check→unlink→create takeover. Execution callers fail closed when ownership
//! cannot be proved.
//!
//! Cooperating processes must run as the same OS identity. Different OS
//! identities are unsupported and mutual exclusion is not guaranteed. The Unix
//! external namespace guard is host-local; Windows relies on one stable user
//! temp directory for that OS identity. The external guard protects new clients
//! from a replaced in-workspace namespace, but older clients know only the
//! permanent `.umadev/run.lock` fence. If that fence is deleted, `.umadev` is
//! replaced, or `git clean -fdx` removes it while an old client may run,
//! old/new mutual exclusion cannot be guaranteed.
//!
//! The workspace root path and every alias used to reach it must also remain
//! stable for the lifetime of a run: do not rename or replace the root, and do
//! not retarget a symlink/junction that was used to enter it. Callers continue
//! using their original project-root path after acquisition, so changing that
//! namespace can redirect later writes outside the identity that was locked.
//!
//! The filesystem must propagate `flock`/`LockFileEx`-equivalent advisory
//! locks coherently. Network mounts without a coherent lock manager are
//! unsupported. Even with coherent advisory locks, a shared workspace is
//! unsupported if its `.umadev` namespace can be replaced during an active
//! run. A single-machine process test cannot certify an NFS/SMB deployment.
//!
//! ## Owner liveness
//!
//! New releases recover automatically through the kernel guard. The owner
//! classifier remains for crash markers and migration diagnostics. An existing
//! legacy `run.lock` is never guessed safe or overwritten; migration is
//! explicit and requires all older UmaDev processes to remain stopped.
//!
//! The shared classifier distinguishes live, provably abandoned, and
//! unattributable owners using host, boot, PID and age. The v2 kernel lock does
//! not need it for takeover; temporary-rewind recovery still does. Legacy lock
//! files are diagnosed with it but remain fail-closed because deleting one
//! after a check would race an older writer's create-new operation.
//!
//! That verdict comes from the internal claim-owner classifier — the single
//! owner-liveness rule shared with the temporary-rewind crash marker in
//! [`crate::checkpoint`]. Two files answering the same question differently
//! is exactly how a live holder's claim gets reclaimed.
//!
//! Liveness probing is conservative: if we cannot determine whether the PID is
//! alive, we do not call it dead; the age fallback eventually frees a genuinely
//! abandoned unattributable claim.
