//! Dynamic phase planner — the "dynamic agent" layer.
//!
//! UmaDev's canonical pipeline is the full nine-phase chain
//! ([`umadev_spec::PHASE_CHAIN`]). Forcing EVERY task through all nine phases is
//! exactly the rigidity the SOTA agent literature warns against: a fixed
//! workflow is the right call for *well-defined* work, but a one-line bug fix
//! does not need similar-product research + three core documents + two human
//! confirmation gates + a delivery proof-pack. That rigidity is what makes a
//! pipeline feel "weak" on small or narrow tasks.
//!
//! This module classifies the requirement and tailors WHICH phases run, while
//! (1) preserving the canonical ORDER, and (2) keeping the confirm gates
//! whenever their guarded phase actually runs and the task is heavyweight
//! enough to warrant a human checkpoint.
//!
//! The classifier is deterministic (bilingual zh/en keyword + intent
//! heuristics) so it needs no model call and is fully unit-tested. A
//! brain-assisted refinement can layer on top later without changing this
//! contract. **Fail-open:** an unrecognised requirement falls back to the full
//! [`TaskKind::Greenfield`] pipeline — the planner never produces *fewer*
//! phases than the safe default by accident.
