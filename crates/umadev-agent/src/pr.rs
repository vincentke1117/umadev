//! PR mode — turn a finished run's evidence into the most trustworthy PR on the
//! team.
//!
//! Most generated PRs hand a reviewer raw code and a one-line title. PR mode
//! flips that: it opens a pull request whose **body is the run's own evidence**
//! — the PR-ready review report (`review.rs`: contract / acceptance / coverage /
//! governance / security / runtime + rollback) followed by a proof-pack summary.
//! The reviewer reads a self-asserting, source-cited case for merge, not a diff
//! with no context.
//!
//! This module is **deterministic + fail-open + light-deps**. It never opens a
//! PR itself: it computes *readiness* (is this a git repo? are there uncommitted
//! changes? is there a GitHub remote? is `gh` on PATH and logged in?) and
//! *renders* the body. The binary (`umadev pr`) does the actual `git` / `gh`
//! shell-out and enforces the safety rails. The split keeps every decision here
//! a pure function the unit tests can assert on **without ever pushing or
//! opening a real PR**.
//!
//! Safety contract surfaced as data here, enforced by the caller:
//! - never commit directly on the default branch — branch first
//!   ([`PrPlan::needs_new_branch`]);
//! - never force-push, never rewrite the user's existing commits;
//! - any external probe that errors degrades to "not ready" with a manual hint,
//!   never a panic or a destructive fallback.
