//! Continuous-session run driver — the long-session model (see
//! `docs/CONTINUOUS_SESSION_ARCHITECTURE.md`, §1.5 / 1.6 / 2 / 3 / 3.5).
//!
//! This is the SECOND of the two run paths and lives ALONGSIDE the single-shot
//! [`crate::runner::AgentRunner`] path — it does not replace it. Where the
//! single-shot path runs `Runtime::complete` once per phase (a fresh, stateless
//! base process that narrates a paragraph), this path opens ONE long-lived
//! [`BaseSession`] for the whole run and injects one imperative directive per
//! phase, observing the base's own agentic tool loop (it WRITES files) over the
//! [`SessionEvent`] stream.
//!
//! ## Why a free function over a `Box<dyn BaseSession>` (not a method on
//! `AgentRunner<R>`)
//!
//! `umadev-agent` deliberately does NOT depend on `umadev-host` — it only knows
//! the [`BaseSession`] *trait* from `umadev-runtime`. The host factory covers
//! five bases: three native sessions plus the Grok Build and Kimi Code ACP sessions,
//! all handed in as a trait object. The binary / TUI owns the wiring + the
//! gradual-rollout switch; this module owns the deterministic driving loop.
//!
//! ## What is preserved (the moat — unchanged)
//!
//! 9 phases + both confirm gates + governance pre-write checks + the
//! zero-source HARD STOP + tool-call audit (`UD-EVID-002`) + trust-tiered
//! approval + the single-writer run lock. The role-critic team reviews on
//! read-only `BaseSession::fork()` sessions at each review node (see
//! `run_review_team` / `ForkConsult` below) — parallel, isolated, explicitly
//! typed, and bounded so a failed reviewer cannot hang or masquerade as pass.
//!
//! ## Fail-open, by contract
//!
//! Every failure mode degrades, never panics or wedges:
//! - the session can't start          → caller falls back to the single-shot path;
//! - the event stream ends mid-turn    → that phase is [`TurnStatus::Failed`] →
//!   the run stops with a clear failure, the session is `end()`-ed;
//! - a governance check errors          → governance itself is fail-open (returns
//!   pass), so a buggy rule never blocks the base;
//! - the plan was supposed to produce code and produced ZERO real source files →
//!   HARD STOP, reported as a failure (never disguised as success).

///   all): there is no gate to anchor a block split on, so the WHOLE lean phase
///   list (e.g. Light: spec → frontend → backend → quality) is driven in ONE
