//! Turn-scoped retrieval feedback.
//!
//! Candidate retrieval is pure. Only after the final directive has been accepted
//! by the host does the caller commit an immutable receipt containing the exact
//! content-bound memory IDs and a hash of the sent prompt. A deterministic check
//! then publishes exactly one PASS / FAIL / UNKNOWN intent for that receipt.
//! PASS/FAIL becomes one immutable cross-project usefulness outcome; UNKNOWN is
//! consumed without reward or penalty.
//!
//! Both receipt and outcome intent use temp-file + atomic create-new hard-link
//! publication. There is no overwrite-most-recent state and no shared
//! read-modify-write, so forked turns and separate processes cannot clobber one
//! another. A crash after intent but before usefulness publication is recoverable:
//! replay sees the same immutable receipt ID and the global publisher is
//! idempotent. Every I/O failure stays fail-open and never changes a build verdict.
