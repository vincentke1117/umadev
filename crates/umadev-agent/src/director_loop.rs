//! The director build loop — the USB / smart-hardware model of
//! `docs/AGENT_WIELDS_BASE_ARCHITECTURE.md` (simplified: NO marker protocol).
//!
//! ## The model: UmaDev is firmware; the base is the brain + hands
//!
//! UmaDev is a smart device with its own firmware — a senior team-director
//! identity, engineering taste, accumulated knowledge, governance, and memory —
//! but **no compute of its own**. Plugged into a base (claude / codex / opencode)
//! over the continuous session, it **borrows the base's intelligence and hands**
//! to get work done, the way a smart peripheral borrows a host computer's CPU and
//! storage. The firmware is injected into the base (via the directive + system
//! prompt the caller built — `experts::director_build_directive` /
//! `experts::director_with_team_tools`); the base then thinks, plans, and writes
//! files with its OWN internal agentic tool loop.
//!
//! **The key insight that retired the old marker protocol:** the base is already a
//! whole brain. Once UmaDev's firmware is injected, the base ITSELF plays PM /
//! architect / frontend / QA internally and builds the goal end to end. It does
//! **not** need to emit `<<<umadev:summon …>>>` markers for UmaDev to "summon a
//! team" from the outside — real-machine testing showed the base writes good,
//! multi-role code with ZERO markers, because the team lives inside the base's
//! head, steered by the firmware. So this loop no longer asks the base to speak a
//! scheduling protocol, and no longer parses one.
//!
//! ## The boundary: UmaDev grows NO "operating" machinery of its own
//!
//! The base is a complete Agent already — its model is the brain, its CLI tools are
//! the body that builds code, writes files, runs commands, runs tests, and fixes
//! bugs. UmaDev is the EXTERNAL agent that plugs into that body and shares that
//! brain. So **UmaDev never grows its own build/write/run/test/fix capability** —
//! all of that work is the base's body using the base's own tools. The only two
//! tiny things UmaDev does for itself (firmware business, not "operating"):
//!
//! - **Governance** — the background safety net riding on the base's file writes
//!   (the existing PreToolUse hook). Untouched here.
//! - **A read-only honesty check** — when the base says "built it", UmaDev reads the
//!   disk to confirm real code actually exists ([`crate::acceptance::source_files`]
//!   via [`crate::director::verify`] / [`VerifyKind::SourcePresent`]). Tiny,
//!   deterministic, read-only — it just stops a hallucinated "done".
//!
//! Everything else — building, and FIXING what QC surfaces — the base's body does
//! with its own tools, steered by a fix directive UmaDev feeds back. UmaDev reads
//! objective facts and judges; it does not operate.
//!
//! ## The loop: end-to-end build → UmaDev honesty/QC read → bounded feedback-fix
//!
//! 1. Drive the base end to end on the goal (one firmware-injected turn — its own
//!    agentic tool loop runs PM→…→QA internally and writes real files).
//! 2. When the turn settles, **UmaDev reads reality ITSELF** (it does not wait for
//!    the base to ask, and it does not operate):
//!    - **honesty hard floor (deterministic, read-only)** — did real source files
//!      actually land ([`crate::acceptance::source_files`])? This is UmaDev's own
//!      tiny check.
//!    - **optional fork review (read-only, borrows the brain)** — for a build that
//!      produced real code, fork the review team on isolated read-only sessions and
//!      collect blocking findings ([`crate::director::review`]). UmaDev judges with
//!      the borrowed brain; it writes nothing.
//! 3. If QC found blocking problems, fold them into ONE fix directive and feed it
//!    back to the base over the same session (the USB channel) — and the directive
//!    tells the base's body to **run its own build/test and fix the cause with its
//!    own tools**. Then re-read. **Bounded** by [`MAX_QC_ROUNDS`].
//! 4. Clean (or no code claimed — a chat/plan answer) → done; report honestly.
//!
//! Note on build/test: UmaDev does NOT run the build itself as its gate — the base's
//! body runs build/test (it has the tools), and the fix directive explicitly asks it
//! to. The optional [`VerifyKind::BuildTest`] read is retained only as a cheap
//! reuse of an EXISTING reader to surface an objective failure fact when a manifest
//! is present; it is positioned as "read a fact", never as "UmaDev operates".
//!
//! ## Floor preserved (every invariant still holds)
//!
//! 1. **Single-writer.** Only the MAIN base turn mutates the workspace, under the
//!    run-lock the caller holds. UmaDev's checks are read-only: the source floor
//!    reads disk; the QC review runs on isolated read-only forks
//!    ([`crate::director::review`]). Nothing UmaDev does writes the workspace.
//! 2. **Objective floor untouched.** The source-present floor is a deterministic,
//!    read-only reality check; review verdicts stay advisory (they only seed a fix
//!    directive the base acts on, they never themselves decide "done"). The caller's
//!    source-present hard-gate still runs at the boundary, unchanged.
//! 3. **Governance + audit.** Every base turn (the first build and every fix pass)
//!    drives the SAME governed/audited session; the PreToolUse hook still fires
//!    under every write.
//! 4. **No new endpoint.** Every QC review reads over the SAME borrowed brain + its
//!    `fork()`; no extra model endpoint, no API key.
//! 5. **Fail-open.** A QC read that can't run degrades to "no problem found" (a
//!    review that can't fork accepts), never a false failure that wedges the loop. A
//!    dead session is an honest `Failed`, never a panic.
//! 6. **Reversible.** This loop is the DEFAULT `/run` path; the legacy fixed
//!    pipeline (`UMADEV_LEGACY_PIPELINE=1`) is untouched.

    //     `npm install` + build — minutes), even though the base just ran it and
    //     the fix directive asks it to run it again, and

    //     ever return "no blocking" anyway.
