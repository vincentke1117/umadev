//! The director build loop — the USB / smart-hardware model of
//! `docs/AGENT_WIELDS_BASE_ARCHITECTURE.md` (simplified: NO marker protocol).
//!
//! ## The model: UmaDev is firmware; the base is the brain + hands
//!
//! UmaDev is a smart device with its own firmware — a senior team-director
//! identity, engineering taste, accumulated knowledge, governance, and memory —
//! but **no compute of its own**. Plugged into one of five bases (three native
//! plus Grok Build/Kimi Code over ACP) over the continuous session, it **borrows the base's
//! intelligence and hands**
//! to get work done, the way a smart peripheral borrows a host computer's CPU and
//! storage. The firmware is injected into the base (via the directive + system
//! prompt the caller built — `experts::director_build_directive` /
//! `experts::director_with_team_tools`); the base then thinks, plans, and writes
//! files with its OWN internal agentic tool loop.
//!
//! **The key insight that retired the old marker protocol:** the base is already a
//! whole brain. Once UmaDev's firmware is injected, the base ITSELF plays PM /
//! architect / frontend / QA internally and builds the goal end to end. It does
//! **not** need to emit `<<<umadev:summon …>>>` markers for UmaDev to "summon a
//! team" from the outside — real-machine testing showed the base writes good,
//! multi-role code with ZERO markers, because the team lives inside the base's
//! head, steered by the firmware. So this loop no longer asks the base to speak a
//! scheduling protocol, and no longer parses one.
//!
//! ## The boundary: UmaDev grows NO "operating" machinery of its own
//!
//! The base is a complete Agent already — its model is the brain, its CLI tools are
//! the body that builds code, writes files, runs commands, runs tests, and fixes
//! bugs. UmaDev is the EXTERNAL agent that plugs into that body and shares that
//! brain. So **UmaDev never grows its own build/write/run/test/fix capability** —
//! all of that work is the base's body using the base's own tools. The only two
//! tiny things UmaDev does for itself (firmware business, not "operating"):
//!
//! - **Governance** — the background safety net riding on the base's file writes
//!   (the existing PreToolUse hook). Untouched here.
//! - **A read-only honesty check** — when the base says "built it", UmaDev reads the
//!   disk to confirm real code actually exists ([`crate::acceptance::source_files`]
//!   via [`crate::director::verify`] / [`VerifyKind::SourcePresent`]). Tiny,
//!   deterministic, read-only — it just stops a hallucinated "done".
//!
//! Everything else — building, and FIXING what QC surfaces — the base's body does
//! with its own tools, steered by a fix directive UmaDev feeds back. UmaDev reads
//! objective facts and judges; it does not operate.
//!
//! ## The loop: end-to-end build → UmaDev honesty/QC read → bounded feedback-fix
//!
//! 1. Drive the base end to end on the goal (one firmware-injected turn — its own
//!    agentic tool loop runs PM→…→QA internally and writes real files).
//! 2. When the turn settles, **UmaDev reads reality ITSELF** (it does not wait for
//!    the base to ask, and it does not operate):
//!    - **honesty hard floor (deterministic, read-only)** — did real source files
//!      actually land ([`crate::acceptance::source_files`])? This is UmaDev's own
//!      tiny check.
//!    - **optional fork review (read-only, borrows the brain)** — for a build that
//!      produced real code, fork the review team on isolated read-only sessions and
//!      collect blocking findings ([`crate::director::review`]). UmaDev judges with
//!      the borrowed brain; it writes nothing.
//! 3. If QC found blocking problems, fold them into ONE fix directive and feed it
//!    back to the base over the same session (the USB channel) — and the directive
//!    tells the base's body to **run its own build/test and fix the cause with its
//!    own tools**. Then re-read. **Bounded** by the internal QC-round limit.
//! 4. Clean mechanical QC → done; report honestly. A quiet/tool-only reply is
//!    never completion evidence by itself.
//!
//! Note on build/test: UmaDev does NOT run the build itself as its gate — the base's
//! body runs build/test (it has the tools), and the fix directive explicitly asks it
//! to. The optional [`VerifyKind::BuildTest`] read is retained only as a cheap
//! reuse of an EXISTING reader to surface an objective failure fact when a manifest
//! is present; it is positioned as "read a fact", never as "UmaDev operates".
//!
//! ## Floor preserved (every invariant still holds)
//!
//! 1. **Single-writer.** Only the MAIN base turn mutates the workspace, under the
//!    run-lock the caller holds. UmaDev's checks are read-only: the source floor
//!    reads disk; the QC review runs on isolated read-only forks
//!    ([`crate::director::review`]). Nothing UmaDev does writes the workspace.
//! 2. **Objective floor untouched.** The source-present floor remains a
//!    deterministic, read-only check. Reviewer blockers seed bounded fixes and
//!    must clear before a clean claim; Rust-side budgets still own termination.
//! 3. **Governance + audit.** Every base turn (the first build and every fix pass)
//!    drives the SAME governed/audited session; the PreToolUse hook still fires
//!    under every write.
//! 4. **No new endpoint.** Every QC review reads over the SAME borrowed brain + its
//!    `fork()`; no extra model endpoint, no API key.
//! 5. **Bounded failure.** A required review that cannot run is explicitly
//!    unavailable, never a pass. It may leave the build incomplete, but cannot
//!    wedge the loop; a dead session is an honest `Failed`, never a panic.
//! 6. **Reversible.** This loop is the DEFAULT `/run` path; the legacy fixed
//!    pipeline (`UMADEV_LEGACY_PIPELINE=1`) is untouched.

// THAT step's `acceptance` on the deterministic floor, and only ticks `Done` when
// the floor passes; a failing step folds its blocking findings into a bounded fix
// loop (reusing MAX_QC_ROUNDS + a stall guard, mirroring `review_and_rework`).
// Review steps fork the cross-review team. The lean/Fast path never reaches here.
//
// INVARIANTS (identical to the single-turn loop): single-writer (only `summon`'s
// Serial main turn writes; reviews run on read-only forks), idle watchdog (each
// summon's turn pump is `drive_rework_turn`, idle-guarded), hard floor (the SAME
// content-governance scan + source-present floor run as the final QC gate), bounded
// (a per-step fix budget + an overall step ceiling), fail-open (any summon / verify
// that can't run degrades to "advance the step" — never a wedge, never a false
// failure — and a first-step failure degrades the WHOLE path to the single turn).

/// `TestFailsThenPasses` contract → **RED→GREEN**: the named test must FAIL at the
/// step's pre-state and PASS at head. The falsifiable form of "test-first".
///
/// ## Why this check exists
/// `TestPasses` is satisfied by a test written AFTER the code it "checks". Such a test
/// asserts whatever the implementation already happens to do; it passes on its first
/// run and has never once demonstrated that it can detect the behaviour's ABSENCE. It
/// is a rubber stamp with a green tick. The ONE mechanical property that separates a
/// real test from a rubber stamp is that a real test **failed once** — before the
/// change that made it pass. That property is checkable, and this is the check.
///
/// ## How
/// 1. **Head, green half.** The test must be PRESENT in the source (a test that does
///    not exist cannot pass — and this also closes the "a filter that matches nothing
///    exits 0" hole that would otherwise let a runner report success for a test that
///    isn't there) and must PASS when run by name. A failing/absent test at head is a
///    gap, exactly as `TestPasses` would report.
/// 2. **Pre-state, red half.** Rewind the workspace to the step's pre-state in a
///    SCOPED, REVERSIBLE way ([`crate::checkpoint::begin_temp_rewind`] — the present is
///    snapshotted and anchored first, and restored on the way out even through a panic;
///    dependency trees / build caches are outside the shadow repo, so the source goes
///    back in time and the toolchain does not, which is what makes the rewound tree
///    runnable). Run the SAME single test there. It must FAIL — or not exist at all,
///    which is the same fact stated more strongly.
/// 3. Restore head. (Unconditional: `TempRewind` restores on drop.)
///
/// A test that was **already green at the pre-state** rejects the step, and says so
/// plainly. That is not a bug in the check; it is the entire point of it.
///
/// ## Fail-open (never block on our own inability to verify)
/// Every inconclusive edge — no pre-state checkpoint (no `git`/shadow repo), the rewind
/// could not be taken, no test runner on PATH, an unrecognised project, a timeout —
/// degrades to exactly the existing [`test_passes_outcome`] semantics. We hold the step
/// to the bar we CAN check, never to a verdict we could not reach. Only a positively
/// observed "it was already passing" is a finding.
///
/// Bounded: at most two runs of ONE named test (never the whole suite), each capped by
/// [`crate::verify::run_named_test`]'s own timeout.
