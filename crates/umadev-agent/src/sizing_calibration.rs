//! Prediction-sizing calibration — UmaDev's own measured self-evolution doctrine.
//!
//! Every turn the router / planner make TWO predictions: the intent **class** and the
//! complexity **sizing** (the kind / depth / team they pick). [`crate::first_pass`]
//! already measures whether the cheap path's proposals SURVIVE verification — that is a
//! *quality* signal. This module measures the ORTHOGONAL thing the router is never
//! scored on: was the **SIZING** right?
//!
//! - a route sized **Light / small** that actually needed a real multi-step build
//!   UNDER-sized the turn (the cheap path escalated);
//! - a route sized **Greenfield / Deep** that finished in one trivial step OVER-sized it
//!   (the heavy machinery produced a trivial result).
//!
//! Nothing learns from a *systematic* sizing miss today, so the router keeps making it.
//! Per route-class this records (predicted size vs. the run's actual size) and exposes
//! ONE advisory adjustment ([`sizing_calibration`]): a class that consistently
//! UNDER-sizes nudges its DEFAULT heavier, one that consistently OVER-sizes nudges it
//! lighter.
//!
//! **Fail-open + advisory by contract** (identical to [`crate::first_pass`]). A missing
//! or corrupt file yields *no signal* and never panics; recording a run's outcome never
//! affects that run's route, plan, deterministic floor, gates, or termination — the
//! route is already decided by the time the outcome is known. The adjustment only ever
//! informs a DEFAULT / PRIOR ([`calibrated_default`]); it never overrides the brain's
//! per-turn decision and never touches the deterministic floor or any gate.
