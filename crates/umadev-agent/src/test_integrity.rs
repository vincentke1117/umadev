//! Test-integrity guard — a deterministic, fail-open anti-reward-hacking floor
//! over the **test files** the team edits during a build step (UD-QA-001).
//!
//! A borrowed brain can make a failing suite "pass" without delivering working
//! code by **gaming the tests** instead of fixing the implementation: deleting a
//! test file, removing a test function, stripping assertions out of a kept test,
//! marking a test `skip` / `xfail` / `.only` / `#[ignore]`, commenting the
//! checks out, hard-coding the implementation's exact output as the expected
//! value, or weakening the test runner / test command itself. Every one of those
//! moves makes `npm test` / `pytest` / `cargo test` report green — so a check
//! that only reads "did the suite pass?" is fooled.
//!
//! UmaDev owns a **deterministic floor the borrowed brain cannot edit**. This
//! module makes that floor *enforce test integrity*: it snapshots the project's
//! test files BEFORE a build step's doer turn and compares them to the AFTER
//! state, flagging the gaming signals above. A violation means the step's passing
//! test signal is **not trusted** — the finding is folded into the step's
//! deterministic acceptance as a blocking signal (see
//! the director loop's internal build-step driver) and drives a bounded rework round
//! with a typed, evidence-bearing directive that names the gamed file. A
//! genuinely-passing, un-gamed suite produces no findings and is unaffected.
//!
//! **Fail-open by contract.** If integrity cannot be determined — no baseline
//! snapshot, an unreadable tree, an unparseable file — the guard returns *no
//! findings* (it never fabricates a block). Adding new tests is never a
//! violation; only the destruction / weakening of pre-existing test signal is.
//! Every heuristic is comparative (before vs after) and the rework it triggers is
//! bounded by the caller's existing fix-round / stall counters, so a heuristic
//! false-positive can never become an infinite rework loop.
