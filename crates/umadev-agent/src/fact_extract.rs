//! Active fact-extraction **backstop** — UmaDev records durable project facts
//! ITSELF, instead of trusting the base to volunteer them.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (the recording side was unreliable)
//!
//! [`crate::project_facts`] recalls durable facts into work-turn firmware. Earlier
//! versions also asked the base to append the store directly, which was unreliable
//! and bypassed validation. The store is now written only through this controlled
//! extraction path.
//!
//! ## What this module does
//!
//! After a meaningful WORK turn (a build step that completed, a turn that resolved
//! paths / ran build-test commands / established constraints — never pure chat),
//! UmaDev asks the borrowed brain — on a READ-ONLY `fork()`, the SAME seam the
//! critics ([`crate::critics`]) and the brain router ([`crate::router`]) use — to
//! list the durable facts the turn established as concise `key: value` lines (or
//! `none`). It then parses those lines and writes them via
//! [`crate::project_facts::record_facts`] (which dedups by key + enforces the
//! bounds and credential checks), so the store reliably populates without allowing
//! the base to write durable memory directly.
//!
//! ## Bounded + fail-open by contract
//!
//! - **Work-class only.** Pure [`RouteClass::Chat`] / [`RouteClass::Explain`]
//!   establish nothing durable, so they never fork and never spend a token (see
//!   the internal route-extraction classifier) — exactly the firmware's work-class gate.
//! - **Throttled.** Even on a long multi-step build the extraction runs only on a
//!   bounded subset of work turns (via the internal extraction guard) — once early so a one-step
//!   build still populates the file, then every Nth turn — never once per step.
//! - **Fail-open.** A failed/wedged fork, an offline brain, a timeout, an empty /
//!   `none` reply, an unparseable reply, or an unwritable store all degrade to
//!   "no facts written" (`0`). This module NEVER panics and NEVER returns an error
//!   that could break the turn.
