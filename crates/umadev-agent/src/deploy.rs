//! Deploy adapter — the engine's "ship it" capability, the optional handoff
//! step that closes the commercial-delivery loop *after* `delivery`.
//!
//! `delivery` produces the proof-pack (docs + quality + compliance + a runnable
//! build). What it does NOT do is put the product on a public URL. This module
//! is the bridge to "it's live": it
//!
//! 1. **Detects** the deploy target from the workspace's own files — a
//!    `vercel.json` / Next.js app → Vercel, `netlify.toml` → Netlify, a
//!    `Dockerfile` → a container image, `fly.toml` → Fly.io, a built static
//!    `dist/` / `out/` → a static host. Each target carries the exact CLI
//!    command a user would run.
//! 2. **Executes** that command as a subprocess **only when the user explicitly
//!    triggers a deploy** (the binary/TUI gates this behind a confirm). The
//!    actual deploy is the *user's* action against *their own* logged-in
//!    platform CLI — UmaDev never deploys on its own, owns no credentials, and
//!    injects nothing into the platform.
//! 3. Captures the **preview URL + log tail** into a structured [`DeployProof`]
//!    that is serialized to `.umadev/audit/deploy-proof.json` and folded into
//!    the delivery proof-pack (see `phases::build_and_zip_proof_pack`).
//!
//! Everything here is **fail-open**: an unrecognised platform, a missing deploy
//! CLI, or a failed/timed-out deploy degrades to a `NotDeployed(reason)` record
//! with a manual-deploy hint — never a panic, never a blocked host. User-facing
//! prose lives in the binary (which owns the i18n catalog); this crate stays
//! dependency-light and emits machine-readable data plus a neutral summary line.
