//! Auto-sediment capture layer — turns development experience into persistent
//! knowledge that makes the tool stronger with every run.
//!
//! Until 4.8 UmaDev was stateless across runs: quality-gate failures were
//! overwritten, gate-revision feedback was consumed once then discarded, and
//! the `.umadev/decisions/` directory the spec promised was never written
//! to. This module closes that loop:
//!
//! - [`capture_quality_failures`] — appends every failed/warning quality
//!   check to `.umadev/learned/_raw/quality-failures.jsonl`.
//! - [`capture_gate_revision`] — writes a real ADR (Architecture Decision
//!   Record) to `.umadev/decisions/<gate>-<ts>.md`, fulfilling the spec's
//!   long-standing empty promise. Also appends a raw lesson.
//! - [`capture_validated_patterns`] — records schemas/decisions that passed
//!   the quality gate, so future runs can reuse proven patterns.
//!
//! All captures are fail-open: a write error is logged but never blocks the
//! pipeline. The raw JSONL files are consumed by [`sediment_lessons`] (step
//! 2) which turns them into retrievable markdown.

// the broader, value-weighted question "when this lesson was put in front of
// the worker, did the gate then PASS or FAIL?". A pass nudges the lesson's
// trust up a little; a fail pushes it down harder (asymmetric). Trust folds
// into `lesson_decay_score`, so a lesson that keeps coinciding with failures
// quietly sinks in recall while a reliably-helpful one floats up — upgrading
// "was it reused?" to "did reusing it actually help?".
//
// WIRING POINTS (where the runner feeds verify results back):
//   - PASS  → `reward_trust_for_signatures(root, &surfaced_sigs)` after a
//             verify/quality gate passes, OR `reward_injected_lessons(root,
//             &injected_ids)` for non-pitfall lessons.
//   - FAIL  → `penalize_trust_for_signatures(root, &surfaced_sigs)` after the
//             gate fails with those lessons in the prompt.
// The dev-error reflux can ride the EXISTING `mark_pitfalls_resolved` /
// `apply_dev_error_trust` seam (see `apply_dev_error_trust`), which the runner
// already calls at the verify-pass site (runner.rs ~L1135) and could call with
