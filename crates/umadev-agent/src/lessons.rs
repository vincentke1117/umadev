//! Auto-sediment capture layer — turns development experience into persistent
//! knowledge that makes the tool stronger with every run.
//!
//! Until 4.8 UmaDev was stateless across runs: quality-gate failures were
//! overwritten, gate-revision feedback was consumed once then discarded, and
//! the `.umadev/decisions/` directory the spec promised was never written
//! to. This module closes that loop:
//!
//! - [`capture_quality_failures`] — appends every failed/warning quality
//!   check to `.umadev/learned/_raw/quality-failures.jsonl`.
//! - [`capture_gate_revision`] — writes a real ADR (Architecture Decision
//!   Record) to `.umadev/decisions/<gate>-<ts>.md`, fulfilling the spec's
//!   long-standing empty promise. Also appends a raw lesson.
//! - [`capture_validated_patterns`] — records schemas/decisions that passed
//!   the quality gate, so future runs can reuse proven patterns.
//!
//! All captures are fail-open: a write error is logged but never blocks the
//! pipeline. The raw JSONL files are consumed by [`sediment_lessons`] (step
//! 2) which turns them into retrievable markdown.
