//! Trust / autonomy tiers — the control layer over the confirmation gates.
//!
//! UmaDev's pipeline already has human-in-the-loop gates (`docs_confirm`,
//! `preview_confirm`) plus a binary autonomous toggle. This module generalises
//! that toggle into a **progressive-trust ladder** so a user can pick how much
//! autonomy to grant as their confidence in the agent grows:
//!
//! - [`TrustMode::Plan`]    — **planning with read-only requested**. UmaDev
//!   refuses every explicit run entry before locks, branches, persisted state,
//!   artifacts, or a writer; the base's actual process boundary still requires
//!   vendor/platform effective-state evidence.
//! - [`TrustMode::Guarded`] — the **default**; the existing human-in-the-loop
//!   behaviour — every gate pauses for an explicit confirmation.
//! - [`TrustMode::Auto`]    — fully autonomous; every gate auto-approves
//!   (the existing `/auto` behaviour, preserved unchanged).
//!
//! Two safety/trust mechanisms ride on top of the ladder:
//!
//! 1. **Reversibility-weighted escalation** ([`reversibility_class`] /
//!    [`floor_escalates`] / [`requires_confirmation`]): an edit inside the
//!    project tree is cheap and reversible, so it stays light-touch even in
//!    `auto`. The TRUE-DISASTER classes — a destructive shell verb,
//!    version-control internals / history rewrite (incl. force-push), an
//!    obfuscated payload, a credential-exfiltrating network command, a write
//!    that escapes the workspace — are escalated to a confirmation **regardless
//!    of mode**; `auto` does not get to skip them. The ORDINARY network reach
//!    (a dependency install, a plain fetch/push) is confirmed under
//!    `guarded`/`plan` but runs freely under `auto` — installing dependencies
//!    is normal dev work, not an irreversible disaster.
//! 2. **Collaborative trust tracking** ([`TrustLedger`]): per project, per gate,
//!    we record how many times in a row the user auto-approved (or the gate
//!    auto-passed). After a threshold of consecutive passes we *suggest* — never
//!    silently switch — that the user let that gate auto-advance. Persisted to
//!    `.umadev/trust.json`, fully fail-open.
//!
//! Everything here is **deterministic**: the mode defines an execution ceiling
//! and gate auto-pass policy, while the reversibility classifier is a pure
//! function of the action string. No new model endpoint, no randomness.
