//! Trust / autonomy tiers — the control layer over the confirmation gates.
//!
//! UmaDev's pipeline already has human-in-the-loop gates (`docs_confirm`,
//! `preview_confirm`) plus a binary autonomous toggle. This module generalises
//! that toggle into a **progressive-trust ladder** so a user can pick how much
//! autonomy to grant as their confidence in the agent grows:
//!
//! - [`TrustMode::Plan`]    — research + planning only; **read-only, never
//!   executes** real code. The agent produces "here's how I'd do it" for review.
//! - [`TrustMode::Guarded`] — the **default**; the existing human-in-the-loop
//!   behaviour — every gate pauses for an explicit confirmation.
//! - [`TrustMode::Auto`]    — fully autonomous; every gate auto-approves
//!   (the existing `/auto` behaviour, preserved unchanged).
//!
//! Two safety/trust mechanisms ride on top of the ladder:
//!
//! 1. **Reversibility-weighted escalation** ([`reversibility_class`] /
//!    [`requires_confirmation`]): an edit inside the project tree is cheap and
//!    reversible, so it stays light-touch even in `auto`. An action that touches
//!    version-control internals, the network, or is a destructive shell verb is
//!    **irreversible / blast-radius-heavy** and is escalated to a confirmation
//!    **regardless of mode** — `auto` does not get to skip it. This is the hard
//!    safety floor.
//! 2. **Collaborative trust tracking** ([`TrustLedger`]): per project, per gate,
//!    we record how many times in a row the user auto-approved (or the gate
//!    auto-passed). After a threshold of consecutive passes we *suggest* — never
//!    silently switch — that the user let that gate auto-advance. Persisted to
//!    `.umadev/trust.json`, fully fail-open.
//!
//! Everything here is **deterministic**: the mode only changes the gate
//! auto-pass policy and the reversibility classifier is a pure function of the
//! action string. No new model endpoint, no randomness.
