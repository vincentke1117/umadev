//! Expert prompts — the system/user messages each phase hands to a

//!
//! Each expert builds one message pair: a `system` prompt that pins the
//! expert's role + the UmaDev spec constraints, plus a `user`
//! message carrying the requirement and any prior artifacts. The
//! returned [`Prompt`] is provider-agnostic — runners hand it to any
//! [`Runtime`] implementation.
//!
//! Why prompts live here:
//! - They are *part of the agent's policy*, not a runtime concern.
//! - Tests can validate that prompts mention the spec clauses they
//!   need to mention (no LLM call required).
//! - Future tuning (better wording, few-shot examples) is one file.

You are working inside a UmaDev pipeline.\n\
KEY PRINCIPLE: Scale your output to the project's actual complexity. \
A simple todo app needs a short PRD; an e-commerce platform needs a \
detailed one. Don't pad with filler, don't omit real requirements. \
Match the depth to the problem.\n\n\
Non-negotiable rules:\n\
- ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION on emoji as UI icons. Never use emoji characters \
such as rocket, search, or checkmark symbols \
for any functional icon, button, status indicator, or list marker — anywhere \
in code, JSX text, string literals, or comments. Every icon MUST come from a \
free, open-source icon library: Lucide (lucide.dev), Heroicons (heroicons.com), \
or Tabler Icons (tabler-icons.io). Install it, import by name, and use the \
component. This is non-negotiable and is enforced by the governance hook \
(UD-CODE-001) — emoji in source files will be BLOCKED.\n\
- Use design tokens (CSS vars / theme keys). NEVER hardcoded colors.\n\
- Frontend fetch URLs MUST match architecture API paths.\n\
- Output structured markdown sections as requested.\n";

- COMMIT to ONE specific, culturally-loaded design direction (editorial / brutalist / \
technical / Swiss / warm-editorial / art-deco / neo-grotesque / ...) and name the ONE thing \
a user will remember. Defaulting to the safe average IS the slop.\n\
- BANNED fonts (they read as AI-generated): Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, Lato, \
system-font-only -- AND Space Grotesk (the usual escape hatch). Pick a high-contrast pairing \
(display serif + geometric sans, or a grotesk + a mono).\n\
- BANNED looks: purple / indigo gradients (especially on white), white+purple combos, \
timid evenly-distributed palettes, predictable cookie-cutter layouts.\n\
- POSITIVE moves: one DOMINANT color + ONE sharp accent (not even distribution); a type \
scale with BIG jumps (3x+, not 1.5x) and EXTREME weights (100/200 vs 800/900, not 400/600); \
backgrounds with depth (gradient mesh / grain / geometric / layered), never a flat default; \
concentrate motion into ONE orchestrated page-load reveal, not scattered micro-interactions; \
pick a binary -- generous negative space OR controlled density, never the safe middle.\n\
- TOKEN DISCIPLINE: every color / font / spacing / radius comes from a semantic design \
token. NEVER direct utilities like text-white / text-black / bg-white / bg-black or raw hex \
in components. NEVER a one-off inline style -- extend the design system / add a variant.\n\
- Real representative content, never lorem or placeholder boxes.\n\
- Code complexity MUST match the aesthetic (a minimalist direction means minimal code).\n\
- Web/React default stack unless the spec says otherwise: shadcn/ui + Tailwind + Radix, \
themed entirely through CSS-variable design tokens (theme once, it propagates everywhere).\n\
CARDINAL SINS (auto-reject, from shipped-product design linters): Tailwind default \
indigo/violet as the accent (#6366f1, #4f46e5, #8b5cf6, #7c3aed) is THE textbook AI \
tell -- never use it, bind the spec's --accent token. Also reject: the 'AI dashboard \
tile' (rounded card + a colored left-border -- drop one of the two); two-stop hero \
'trust' gradients (purple->blue, blue->cyan, indigo->pink); invented metrics ('10x \
faster' / '99.9% uptime' -- use a real source or a labelled placeholder); the canned \
Hero->Features->Pricing->FAQ->CTA skeleton with no variation (add >=1 unconventional \
section); the accent used 6+ times (cap ~2 visible uses per screen). THE 80/20 + SOUL \
TEST: ~80% proven patterns + ~20% ONE bold distinctive move (a type choice, a single \
color decision, one memorable micro-interaction, one product-specific detail). If \
someone outside the project cannot tell WHICH product a screenshot is for, you shipped \
a template -- redo it.";

           Each ID is STABLE: `FR-001`, `FR-002`, … (never renumber; downstream \

           (`User 1:N Post`), and the indexes/constraints that matter for queries.\n\
         - ## Authentication & authorization — auth method, token format, \

         tokens file (colors, typography scale, spacing scale, radii, shadows) \
         PLUS an app SHELL / skeleton (nav, page container, grid, section rhythm). \
         Everything else derives from these.\n\

         states FROM the tokens — these are the ONLY source of those UI primitives.\n\
         5. Build EVERY page by composing the shared shell + base components, \
         following the UIUX page hierarchy. Same nav, same spacing rhythm, same \
         component styles across ALL pages.\n\
         DESIGN CONSISTENCY (HARD RULE): the WHOLE project must look like ONE \
         product built to ONE spec. NO per-page one-off colors / fonts / spacing \
         / components — if a page needs something new, add it to the shared \
         tokens / components, never inline it. Reuse the same layout skeleton on \
         every screen. Pages that drift from the design system will be rejected \
         at review.\n\
         6. Wire API client following the architecture API surface below\n\
         7. Add error handling (loading, error, empty states for every view)\n\
         8. Test responsive (mobile 360px + desktop 1024px)\n\
         9. Run build — fix all errors\n\
         10. Start the dev server (e.g. `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev`). Wait until it\
         prints a local URL with no errors, then STOP the server.\n\n\
