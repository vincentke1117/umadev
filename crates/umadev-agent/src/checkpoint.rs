//! File-level checkpoint / rewind over the project workspace.
//!
//! Distinct from [`crate::state`] snapshots (which capture only the workflow
//! *phase*): a checkpoint is a full snapshot of the FILES the base wrote, so the
//! user can rewind a whole phase's worth of work — the feature every hot AI
//! coding tool ships (Cline shadow-git, Claude Code `/rewind`, Aider `/undo`).
//!
//! Implemented as a SHADOW git repo at `.umadev/checkpoints.git` (a separate
//! `--git-dir`, work-tree = project root) so it never touches the user's own
//! `.git` history. Every function is FAIL-OPEN: if `git` is missing or any step
//! fails it returns `None` / `Err` quietly and the pipeline is never blocked.
//!
//! This is the director's checkpoint — a phase-level safety net that composes
//! with (does not replace) a base CLI's own per-edit checkpointing.
