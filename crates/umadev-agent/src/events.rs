//! Engine event stream — the channel the orchestrator talks to a UI on.
//!
//! The CLI does not need events (it prints a final report), so it
//! passes a [`NullSink`]. The TUI (M3) passes a [`ChannelSink`] and
//! renders frames as events arrive. Tests use [`RecordingSink`] to
//! assert the exact event sequence a run produces.
//!
//! Events are *observational*: emitting one never changes pipeline
//! behavior, and a sink that drops every event is always valid.
