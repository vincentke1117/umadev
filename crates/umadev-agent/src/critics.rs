//! Role-critic team layer — makes UmaDev's *implicit* role team explicit.
//!
//! UmaDev already plays several roles in sequence (a PM intake plan, a tech-lead
//! docs assessment, a senior-design review, an acceptance director). Those were
//! ad-hoc one-off judges scattered through the runner. This module gives them a
//! single, uniform shape — a [`RoleVerdict`] schema and a [`RoleCritic`] trait —
//! so a real cross-review *team* can be modelled: each role reviews the shared
//! artifacts from its own seat and returns a structured verdict.
//!
//! HARD INVARIANTS (never break — these are what keep a critic team SAFE):
//!
//! 1. **Failure is explicit.** A critic that errors, can't be forked, or returns
//!    unparseable output yields [`ReviewStatus::Unavailable`], never a fabricated
//!    pass. The bounded driver keeps running, while completion logic can report
//!    that the required review did not happen.
//! 2. **Bounded loop control.** A must-fix verdict may trigger bounded rework and
//!    prevent a false clean-completion claim, but it never chooses retry counts.
//!    Rust-side budgets and stall guards always terminate the loop.
//! 3. **Single-writer / read-only.** A critic NEVER writes files or mutates the
//!    workspace. It reviews artifacts on an ISOLATED forked session (clean,
//!    no-resume) and returns a verdict. Only the main session ever writes.
//! 4. **No new endpoint.** A critic runs over the SAME borrowed brain via the
//!    existing host-driver subprocess (`fork()` + `consult`) — no extra model
//!    endpoint, no extra API key.
//!
//! These constraints are why the team layer is a pure *governance* upgrade: it
//! adds cross-review opinions and an audit trail without ever risking the host.

             (0) DIRECTION BEFORE TOKENS — does `## Visual direction` actually DECIDE? It \
             must carry: a one-line design read naming the REGISTER (`brand` = landing / \
             marketing / portfolio, design IS the product; `product` = app / dashboard / \
             admin / devtool, design SERVES the task); a color commitment level \
             (restrained | committed | full-palette | drenched); the light-vs-dark theme \
             decided by a PHYSICAL-SCENE sentence (who / where / what ambient light / what \
             mood); 2-3 NAMED anchor references EACH bound to one dimension (density from \
             one, type from another, whitespace from a third); and anti-goals. \
             ADJECTIVES ARE NOT ANCHORS — 'modern', 'clean', 'professional' decide nothing \
             and must be BLOCKED. A token set with no direction behind it is a hex guess.\n\
             (1) REGISTER FIT — the single most expensive design mistake is applying \
             MARKETING rules to a PRODUCT surface. On a `product` surface, a familiar \
             neutral system font is CORRECT (not a defect), the type scale is a FIXED \
             1.125-1.2 ratio, there is NO page-load choreography, restrained color is the \
             floor, and density is a virtue — BLOCK a dashboard dressed as a landing page \
             (display face, 3x type jumps, extreme weights, decorative background, entrance \
             animation). On a `brand` surface, BLOCK the opposite failure: a system-font, \
             flat-hierarchy, no-commitment page.\n\
             (2) Is there a real DESIGN SYSTEM — a token scale for color, typography, \
             spacing, radii and motion, where EVERY surface token ships a paired `on-` \
             foreground — rather than ad-hoc values?\n\
             (3) Is the information architecture + visual hierarchy coherent and usable, \
             and are the core component states specified (default / hover / focus / active / \
             disabled / loading / error)?\n\
             (4) The TASTE call a detector can't make: does it read as a deliberate, \
             on-brand commercial product rather than a generic AI-generated template?\n\
             BLOCK on: a `## Visual direction` that decides nothing; a register mismatch; \
             no design-token system or unpaired surface tokens; emoji as functional icons; \
             two icon libraries mixed; an AI indigo/violet primary/accent; or a decorative \
