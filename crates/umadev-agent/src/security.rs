//! Pre-PR security scan gate — shell out to whatever scanners are already on
//! the machine, never bundle one.
//!
//! Two scan families, picked by the project's stack:
//! - **secrets** — a leaked-key scanner over the whole tree (`gitleaks`).
//! - **dependencies** — the package-manager's own advisory audit, chosen by the
//!   lockfile present (`npm audit` / `cargo audit` / `pip-audit`).
//!
//! Everything here is **fail-open by contract** (the same rule the governance
//! kernel follows): a missing tool, a non-zero exit we can't parse, a spawn
//! error, or a timeout all collapse to a `skipped`/`error` row with a short
//! reason — never a panic, never a hard block on the pipeline. A scan we could
//! not run is recorded as "not run", not as "clean". The result is written to
//! `.umadev/audit/security-scan.json` and folded into the proof-pack + the
//! review report so a PR reviewer can see exactly what was (and was not) checked.
//!
//! We deliberately do NOT vendor a scanner or add a Rust advisory-DB dep: the
//! value is in surfacing the customer's OWN installed tooling's verdict as
//! reviewable evidence, with zero new heavy transitive deps.
