//! Evidence freshness — the expiry date on a completion claim.
//!
//! **A completion claim is only as fresh as the evidence behind it. Evidence produced
//! before the last change to the code it describes is not evidence.**
//!
//! Every proof UmaDev produces — a green verify run, a runtime proof that booted the
//! app and probed its routes — is a statement about a SPECIFIC state of the source
//! tree. The moment the source changes, that statement stops being about the code we
//! are shipping and becomes a fact about a tree that no longer exists. Left unchecked,
//! that is how "stale green" happens: a proof captured three edits ago is read as
//! today's proof, a broken build ships behind a passing artifact, and the audit trail
//! records a verification that never covered the delivered code.
//!
//! The fix is mechanical, not procedural. Every proof is STAMPED with a fingerprint of
//! the source tree it describes. Re-fingerprint the tree at the moment the proof is
//! CONSUMED; if the two differ, the source moved after the proof was taken and the
//! proof is **stale** — it does not satisfy an evidence contract (the floor re-runs
//! the check for real) and it may not be assembled into a delivery proof-pack (an
//! honest note says so instead).
//!
//! ## It never claims a freshness it cannot establish
//! The fingerprint walks the source tree itself — bounded, but bounded far above any
//! real project ([`MAX_FINGERPRINT_FILES`]). If a tree is SO large that even that bound
//! truncates the walk, the fingerprint **refuses to answer** ([`workspace_fingerprint`]
//! returns `None`) rather than hash a prefix of the tree: a prefix hash would leave
//! every file past the cut-off invisible, so an edit out there would not move the
//! fingerprint and a proof taken BEFORE that edit would be certified as current — the
//! exact "stale green" this module exists to prevent, fired on precisely the large
//! commercial repos where it matters most.
//!
//! ## Cost
//! Metadata only: the walk `lstat`s each candidate (path + size + mtime) and reads no
//! file contents, so a stamp costs a directory walk, not a build. It deliberately does
//! NOT reuse [`crate::acceptance::source_files`], whose 600-file cap and per-file
//! content read serve a different question ("is there substantive source here?"). This
//! one asks "did ANY byte of source move?", and for that a stub file counts too.
//!
//! ## Fail-open (the repo's hard rule)
//! An UNSTAMPED proof (an artifact written by an older build, or one produced where the
//! tree could not be fingerprinted) is **never** stale: an absent fingerprint means "we
//! do not know", and we never block on our own inability to check. A proof that IS
//! stamped, read against a tree we can no longer fingerprint, is not trusted as fresh —
//! but the cost of that is a re-verification, never a block.
