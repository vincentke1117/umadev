//! **Design-system conformance floor** (`UD-CODE-007`, spec §3.7) — the
//! deterministic half of the design moat.
//!
//! The old check was `verify_design_tokens`: it passed if a `design-tokens.*`
//! file merely EXISTED. `:root{--color-bg:#000}` passed. That is theatre — it
//! proves a file was written, not that a design SYSTEM exists, and not that the
//! UI actually uses it. This module upgrades existence into a contract, in four
//! sub-rules, all deterministic, all fail-open:
//!
//! 1. **Schema floor** (`UD-CODE-007a`, blocking) — the token file must declare
//!    a real system: `>= 6` color roles each with a PAIRED `on-` foreground, a
//!    type scale of `>= 4` steps whose adjacent ratio is `>= 1.125`, a 4pt-based
//!    spacing scale, a radius scale, and `>= 2` motion durations + `>= 1` easing.
//! 2. **Contrast** (`UD-CODE-007b`, blocking) — every DECLARED
//!    `(surface, on-surface)` pair is MEASURED with the WCAG formula (pure Rust,
//!    no browser, no deps — see `umadev_governance::color`): `>= 4.5:1` body,
//!    `>= 3:1` large/UI. A failing pair names BOTH tokens and the measured ratio.
//! 3. **Drift** (`UD-CODE-007c`, blocking) — UI source is scanned for literal
//!    colors / font-families / radii / font-sizes that are NOT drawn from the
//!    token set, with tolerances (color ±6 per channel, radius ±0.5px, size
//!    ±0.5px), because a design system nobody imports is not a design system.
//! 4. **Banned brand hue** (`UD-CODE-007d`, blocking) — a declared
//!    primary/accent inside the AI indigo/violet band is rejected UNLESS the
//!    requirement text explicitly asks for purple.
//!
//! Plus the register-scoped design-lint registry
//! (`umadev_governance::scan_design_rules`), whose small P0 tier folds in as
//! blocking and whose advisory tier surfaces as notes.
//!
//! **Fail-open at every edge.** No token file → the report is `unavailable` and
//! the caller keeps today's `DesignTokensPresent` behaviour. An unparseable
//! token file, an unreadable tree, a color syntax we do not know → that
//! contributor simply says nothing. The floor never fabricates a failure and
//! never blocks the host.

/// Verify the designer's **direction step** (`UD-CODE-007f`) — the step that

///
/// A designer that jumps straight to tokens is answering "what hex?" before ever
/// answering "what is this, for whom, and what does it feel like?" — and a token
/// file whose only gate is existence cannot tell the difference. So the plan
/// carries a `design-direction` step whose EVIDENCE is this section, and this
/// section must actually decide things:
///
/// 1. **A one-line design read** — page kind / audience / register / vibe /
///    aesthetic family.
/// 2. **Three forced decisions** — (a) *color commitment level*: one of
///    `restrained` / `committed` / `full-palette` / `drenched` (a level, not
///    "we'll see"); (b) *theme decided by a PHYSICAL SCENE sentence*: who uses
///    this, where, under what ambient light, in what mood — if the sentence does
///    not force light-vs-dark, it is not specific enough yet; (c) *2–3 named
///    anchor references, EACH bound to a specific dimension* (density from one,
///    type from another, whitespace from a third). Adjectives like "modern" /
///    "clean" are REJECTED — they decide nothing.
/// 3. **Anti-goals** — what this product deliberately is NOT.
///
/// ## What blocks, and what merely speaks
/// Only ONE thing blocks: the `## Visual direction` section is **entirely absent** from
/// a UI-bearing run. That is an objective, unambiguous miss — the designer seat was
/// asked for a decision and produced no section at all — and the finding teaches the
/// full recipe.
///
/// Every SUB-CLAUSE (register named, commitment level, scene sentence, bound anchors,
/// anti-goals) is **advisory**. Each is a keyword test over prose, and a keyword test
/// over prose has false negatives: a direction that says "a bright open-plan office; the
/// app is light-first" has decided the theme by a physical scene and names no keyword
/// this scan knows. Blocking on that is blocking a correct answer for being phrased
/// unexpectedly — and the fix the rework directive demands ("add the word `dark`") makes
/// the document worse, not better. They are exactly the notes a designer wants and
/// exactly the wrong thing to stop a build on.
///
/// ## Gating
/// `needs_ui` — the ROUTE's own judgement (`RoutePlan::needs_ui`), not the presence of a
/// file. A file is not a question: a brownfield repo, or a second run in a workspace
/// where an earlier UI build left `output/<slug>-uiux.md` on disk, would otherwise hand
/// a pure backend task a blocking design finding it can neither act on nor escape.
///
/// Fail-open: not a UI run → nothing. No UIUX doc at all → nothing (a project with no
/// design phase is not failed for skipping one). The section is only demanded of a run
/// that is actually building UI and already has a UIUX doc.

# UIUX

## Visual direction

Design read: an internal ops console for warehouse supervisors — register: product —
calm, dense, boringly reliable — aesthetic family: tech-utility.

- Color commitment: restrained. Color is a status signal, never decoration.
- Theme: supervisors work a 12-hour shift on a wall-mounted screen in a loading bay
  lit by overhead sodium lamps and open shutter doors at noon; glare is constant and
  they glance from 3 metres away. That forces a light theme with heavy contrast.
- Anchors:
  - density: from a flight-status board — many true rows, one line each, no cards.
  - type: from a transit signage system — one neutral face, tabular figures.
  - whitespace: from a spreadsheet — tight rows, generous gutters between columns.

Anti-goals: not a consumer dashboard, not a marketing surface, no illustration, no
onboarding delight, no motion beyond a 120ms press confirm.
