//! Bridge for the base's interactive **`AskUserQuestion`** tool.
//!
//! UmaDev drives the base **non-interactively** (claude `--print` / the
//! continuous stream-json session, codex / opencode likewise). When the base
//! calls its OWN `AskUserQuestion` — a structured multiple-choice question — it
//! cannot pop up its own picker without a TTY, so the call auto-cancels mid-turn
//! and the base proceeds as if it got no answer. UmaDev only *observes* the
//! tool-call event, so previously it rendered a bare "AskUserQuestion" stub with
//! NO options and the turn silently read as cancelled — the user never saw the
//! question or the choices.
//!
//! **What is feasible.** The base runs its own `AskUserQuestion` internally; the
//! only mid-turn control channel UmaDev has is the `can_use_tool` permission
//! prompt (allow / deny — not the structured answer). So UmaDev cannot inject a
//! mid-turn tool-result for the base's own picker. What it CAN do — and what this
//! module enables — is:
//!
//! 1. **Render** the question + its numbered options the moment the tool call is
//!    observed ([`surface`]), so the user sees exactly what's being asked.
//! 2. **Relay** the user's choice back to the base as the next turn of the SAME
//!    session ([`relay_directive`]) — the base kept the question in its own
//!    context when it asked it, so a follow-up "the user chose: `<option>`" turn
//!    lets it continue with the answer instead of a silent cancel.
//!
//! Fail-open throughout: a non-question tool call, or an input shape we can't
//! read, yields `None` and the caller keeps its existing tool-row rendering.
