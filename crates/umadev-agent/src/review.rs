//! PR-ready review report — turn the evidence UmaDev already computed into the
//! single artifact a reviewer reads first.
//!
//! Most generated PRs hand a reviewer raw code and a one-line title. This module
//! flips that: it asserts, with a citation to a concrete file/number for each
//! claim, that the change is safe to merge — **CI was not weakened** (no test
//! files deleted, no `it.skip` / `#[ignore]` introduced in the diff), the
//! **API contract** holds (frontend↔backend alignment), **acceptance gaps** are
//! enumerated (planned endpoints with no implementation), the **governance +
//! security scans** verdicts, the **runtime evidence** (the app actually
//! booted + answered), and a **rollback** hint. The reviewer sees exactly what
//! was checked and what to look at by hand.
//!
//! Everything is **fail-open + deterministic + reuse**: no new model endpoint,
//! no new heavy deps. Each section reads an artifact UmaDev already produced
//! (`umadev-contract`, `acceptance`, `coverage`, the quality gate JSON, the
//! `security` scan, the `runtime_proof` JSON) and degrades to an honest "not
//! available" line rather than fabricating a pass. The git-diff CI check is the
//! one live probe; a missing/!git repo simply downgrades to "could not diff".
