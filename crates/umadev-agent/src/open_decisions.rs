//! Durable per-project **OPEN-DECISIONS** memory — the third durable memory
//! channel, a committed parking-lot register for the items a run leaves
//! undecided, deferred, blocked, or parked pending a future trigger.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (a decision-loss bug)
//!
//! During execution — after the spec + tasks are set — a run constantly produces
//! items that are NOT resolvable right now: a missing external key, a downstream
//! task dependency, an ambiguous design decision that needs re-evaluation, an
//! open question, a deferred validation, a boundary held with reservations. Held
//! only in working memory or mentioned once in chat, these fall out of UmaDev's
//! bounded transcript AND out of the base's own context window and are **lost** —
//! no traceability, no resurfacing. Durable FACT memory ([`crate::project_facts`])
//! persists *resolved* facts; the pitfall ledger ([`crate::lessons`]) persists
//! *pitfalls*. Neither keeps the *open, still-unsettled* items a real dev team
//! writes onto a parking-lot / open-decisions list so nothing is dropped.
//!
//! This module is that place — a SIBLING of the durable fact store, modelled on
//! the same read/recall/bound pattern, but deliberately **project-visible and
//! committed** (it lives at [`REGISTER_REL_PATH`] under `docs/`, NOT under the
//! gitignored `.umadev/`) because open decisions are a thing the team + the user
//! should be able to read, review, and diff.
//!
//! ## The loop
//!
//! - **RECORD** — the base may update this project-visible register with its file
//!   tools, in the Markdown shape the firmware directive
//!   ([`decisions_directive`]) documents (a `## OPEN — <category> — <title>`
//!   heading + structured fields). The register is **append-only** and resolved
//!   **in place** (an item is closed by flipping its heading to `## RESOLVED`,
//!   never by deleting it — the trail must survive). [`append_decision`] is the
//!   Rust-side sibling of that append for callers/tests that want to record from
//!   code; it locks the on-disk shape the directive documents.
//! - **RECALL** — [`decisions_recall_block`] renders the still-UNRESOLVED items
//!   as a compact, token-budgeted block prefixed with the
//!   `(N unresolved + M resolved)` summary, which [`crate::context::compose_firmware`]
//!   injects on every WORK turn — so a prior open item auto-resurfaces into the
//!   base's context at task/phase start instead of relying on it to remember to
//!   re-read the file.
//!
//! ## Bounded + fail-open by contract
//!
//! Parsing is capped at the internal entry limit with each field truncated, and
//! the recall block is capped at [`DECISIONS_FIRMWARE_BUDGET`] characters AND
//! the internal recalled-item limit — so the prompt can never bloat under a register
//! that grew to dozens of entries. Every path is fail-open: a missing file, an
//! unreadable file, or malformed / garbage content degrades to "no open
//! decisions" and behaves exactly as before — this module NEVER panics and NEVER
//! returns an error that could block the base.
