//! Own fd 0 and turn raw bytes into [`crossterm::event::Event`]s (UX maturity
//! roadmap §2, P1) — the runtime half of the byte-tokenizer root fix.
//!
//! A blocking thread reads raw bytes from stdin into a [`tokio::sync::mpsc`]
//! channel (honouring `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` — `std::io::stdin().lock()` on a
//! thread, never a `libc::read`). [`OwnedInput`] feeds those bytes through the
//! [`Tokenizer`] + [`Decoder`] and exposes a single async [`OwnedInput::next`]
//! that yields one `Event` at a time, so the existing event loop's
//! key/mouse/paste/resize arm consumes it unchanged.
//!
//! Three things the owned source arms internally:
//! - **bytes** — `mpsc` chunk → `tokenizer.feed` → `decoder` → event queue;
//! - **a PASTE-STATE-AWARE flush timer** (Wave 2 P1) — armed only while the
//!   tokenizer holds a buffered incomplete escape OR the decoder has an open
//!   bracketed paste, and only when no more bytes are already queued (the
//!   pre-gate). The window is ~50 ms normally (a real Esc resolves fast) but
//!   ~500 ms while in paste — a buffered partial mid-paste is almost certainly
//!   a split `\x1b[201~` end marker whose continuation is in flight, and
//!   force-flushing it at 50 ms was the old paste-wedge. On fire, queued bytes
//!   are ingested instead (the re-arm trick); only a genuinely idle FD flushes
//!   — resolving a lone `\x1b` to Esc, or force-closing a paste whose end
//!   marker is not coming;
//! - **SIGWINCH** — owning fd 0 means crossterm's `Event::Resize` (which it
//!   derived from SIGWINCH) is gone, so we install our own safe `tokio::signal`
//!   handler and synthesize `Event::Resize` from [`crossterm::terminal::size`].
//!
//! The legacy `crossterm::EventStream` path is retained behind
//! [`legacy_input_from_env`] (`UMADEV_LEGACY_INPUT=1`) so a tokenizer bug in the
//! field is one env var away from reverting. It is also the default on Windows:
//! console keys such as Esc and arrows can arrive as Windows input records rather
//! than stdin bytes, and crossterm's native backend is the correct reader there.
