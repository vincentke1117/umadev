//! TUI application model.
//!
//! 4.4+ design (Claude Code-style):
//!
//! - **Picker** — shown only on first launch (no `~/.umadev/config.toml`).
//!   Up/Down through detected backends, Enter to confirm, choice saved.
//! - **Chat** — the main screen. Persistent input box at the bottom,
//!   scrolling message history above (user / umadev / host outputs /
//!   gate prompts), status bar on top.
//!
//! Slash commands inside Chat (`/claude` `/codex` `/opencode` `/offline`
//! `/init` `/continue` `/revise` `/diff` `/spec` `/verify`
//! `/doctor` `/help` `/quit` `/clear` `/history` `/commands`) plus normal
//! text.
//!
//! Plain text is NOT classified by the shell. When a gate is open it is a
//! gate reply (approve / revise); otherwise it is routed to the selected
//! **base** (Claude Code / Codex / `OpenCode`), which decides
//! for itself whether the message is conversation or a build request and
//! replies accordingly — UmaDev is only the shell around that base. The
//! running dialogue is kept in [`App::conversation`] and handed to the base
//! on every turn, so chat has memory instead of being amnesiac one-shots.
