//! `umadev-tui` — Claude Code-style terminal app that drives the
//! UmaDev pipeline.
//!
//! Two screens:
//!
//! 1. **Picker** (first launch only) — `↑↓` to choose one of the three base
//!    CLIs (claude-code / codex / opencode), Enter to save to
//!    `~/.umadev/config.toml`. Offline is an internal demo / CI fallback, not
//!    a picker choice.
//! 2. **Chat** — persistent input box + scrolling conversation history.
//!    Type a requirement, watch the pipeline narrate. Slash commands
//!    (`/claude` `/codex` `/opencode` `/init` `/continue` `/revise`
//!    `/spec` `/verify` `/doctor` `/help` `/quit` `/clear`) switch
//!    base, drive gates, etc. (`/offline` exists as the same fallback.)
//!
//! Pipeline blocks run in background `tokio` tasks; each emits
//! [`EngineEvent`]s through a shared [`ChannelSink`]. The event loop
//! folds those events + key presses into [`App`] state and redraws.

/// `Build` intent card), with NO pre-commitment. So:
/// - the intent card shown at dispatch is the behaviour-derived "对话" (Chat) card —
///   honest at t=0, when the only signal is "the user typed a message";
/// - the firmware is sized by a fixed proportional default ([`light_default_route`]
///   — identity + craft + repo-map, but not the heavy full-build layers), since the
///   turn is no longer pre-classified;
/// - a turn that turns out to build re-surfaces a "构建中" card the moment the first
///   file is written (see [`react_to_first_write`]).
///
/// The full plan / team-schedule / finalize delivery flow is the EXPLICIT `/run`
/// director loop (unchanged) — a chat-build runs the base's OWN internal
/// PM→design→code→QA, and the user opts into the heavy flow with `/run`.
///
/// **Why a spawned task:** the event loop's `Action::Route` arm runs inline on the

///    the Windows console / Windows Terminal — scroll or redraw their own
///    buffer while unfocused, desyncing the incremental-diff render; with 1004
///    on, the terminal emits a FocusGained event on return and the event loop

///    `frame.set_cursor_position` in `render_prompt`).
///
/// Shared by BOTH [`setup_terminal`] (startup) and [`reassert_terminal_modes`]
/// (long-input-gap / SIGCONT resume), so a level-triggered DEC private mode can
/// never be enabled at startup yet missed on resume — the "focus reporting
/// worked until a tmux re-attach" bug class. Add any future *level-triggered*
/// mode HERE and both paths get it; then add its symmetric disable to

// the screen for a beat (flicker on any terminal without honest DEC-2026), and
// crossterm's Windows `clear_entire_screen` explicitly `move_to(0, 0)`s, which
// is the cursor-sweep the user saw. So the heal is now split in two:
//
// * [`HealMode::Invalidate`] — DRIFT (streaming heartbeat, resize / focus /
//   size-poll settle). Reset ratatui's previous buffer WITHOUT touching the
//   screen ([`invalidate_frame`]): the next `draw()` then diffs against a
//   poisoned previous buffer, so it re-emits EVERY cell IN PLACE. No `ED(2)`,
//   no `move_to(0, 0)`, no flash, no dependence on synchronized-output support
//   — just the same cells, correctly positioned, painted over the drifted ones.
// * [`HealMode::Erase`] — true CONTAMINATION (an out-of-band write, `Ctrl+L` /
//   `/redraw`, a discrete layout transition): the screen genuinely holds bytes
//   we never wrote, so an erase is what the user asked for. One `terminal.clear()`,
//   once, on a discrete event — never on a cadence.
