//! `umadev-tui` — Claude Code-style terminal app that drives the
//! UmaDev pipeline.
//!
//! Two screens:
//!
//! 1. **Picker** (first launch only) — `↑↓` to choose one of the five
//!    supported base CLIs, Enter to save to
//!    `~/.umadev/config.toml`. Offline is an internal demo / CI fallback, not
//!    a picker choice.
//! 2. **Chat** — persistent input box + scrolling conversation history.
//!    Type a requirement, watch the pipeline narrate. Slash commands
//!    (`/claude` `/codex` `/opencode` `/grok` `/kimi` `/init` `/continue` `/revise`
//!    `/spec` `/verify` `/doctor` `/help` `/quit` `/clear`) switch
//!    base, drive gates, etc. (`/offline` exists as the same fallback.)
//!
//! Pipeline blocks run in background `tokio` tasks; each emits
//! [`EngineEvent`]s through a shared [`ChannelSink`]. The event loop
//! folds those events + key presses into [`App`] state and redraws.

/// [`umadev_agent::drive_director_loop`]: the firmware (team identity + craft) is
/// injected, the base's body builds the goal end to end with its own tools, then

/// floor + the governance hook still apply, and the objective source-present hard-
/// gate runs after the loop reports done.
///
/// All the surrounding TUI machinery is UNCHANGED: tool calls + text stream live
/// via [`EngineEvent::WorkerStream`] (the same render path), and a terminal
/// [`RouteDecision::AgenticDone`] / [`RouteDecision::Failed`] clears `thinking` and
/// records the assistant turn for chat-memory continuity — identical to
/// [`spawn_agentic`]. A NEW base session is opened per `/run` (a director build is
/// a standalone, run-to-settle orchestration, not a gate-anchored block sequence),
/// and `end()`-ed when the loop settles.
///
/// **Fail-open:** a session that can't open / the run-lock held by a DIFFERENT live
/// run emits the honest `ABORT_SENTINEL` note and a terminal `Failed`; a session
/// that dies mid-loop is a `Failed` outcome. It NEVER panics or wedges, and a base
/// whose first build passes QC clean settles immediately (no fix pass).
///
/// **Chat-originated build (`conversation` non-empty):** when a plain chat message
/// auto-promotes into a director build (Blocker #2 — a "build me X" said in chat
/// must get the same plan / step scheduling / finalize / acceptance the `/run` and
/// CLI paths get, NOT the single-turn `drive_agentic_stream`), the caller passes
/// UmaDev's OWN bounded conversation transcript. It is front-loaded onto the first
/// directive so the director's brain sees the prior dialogue (Wave 5 / G11 memory),
/// exactly the way `drive_agentic_stream` threads it for a light chat turn — the
/// base's `--resume` is belt-and-suspenders, this transcript is the load-bearing
/// memory across a restart / switched base. An explicit `/run` passes an empty
/// transcript (no prior chat to inherit) and is unchanged. The session hand-back to
/// chat is driven by the caller's `app.director_run_in_flight` + the terminal
/// `RouteDecision::AgenticDone`, identical for both origins.

/// Drive ONE chat turn over the **resident** base session — the latency fix.
///
/// Opens the writer lazily, keeps its pre-warm identity free of old task authority,
/// then asks a fresh read-only child for a semantic route before every real turn.
/// The chosen route supplies the proportional firmware and execution boundary; a
/// healthy Build hands the already-open writer to the director rather than opening
/// another writer process.
///
/// The drain mirrors the director loop's [`SessionEvent`] → [`EngineEvent`] mapping
/// (the SAME `WorkerStream` render path), so tool calls + text stream live exactly
/// as before. Four behaviours ride the drain with explicit settlement:
/// - **Model-first routing** — Chat/Explain are read-only, small writes stay scoped,
///   and Build/deep Debug enter the director before the writer acts;
/// - **Write truth** — a bounded pre/post content fingerprint catches every base/QC
///   write and blocks success when the route's scope/budget contract is violated;
/// - **Trust gate** — a `NeedApproval` is answered by the always-on irreversible
///   floor (`requires_confirmation`): an irreversible action is denied with a note,
///   everything else allowed (so a guarded turn isn't wedged headless);
/// - **Settle** — `TurnDone` ends the drain, parks the LIVE session back into the
///   holder for the next turn, runs the post-turn fact line + the source hard-gate
///   (for a reactively-promoted build), and sends the terminal `AgenticDone`.
///
/// **Fail-open by contract:** a session that can't open, a `send_turn` that fails,
/// or a base that ACTUALLY died mid-drain is an honest terminal `Failed` — the holder
/// is cleared so the NEXT turn re-opens a fresh session, and the conversation
/// transcript UmaDev holds re-primes it after the loss. But a *transient* failure
/// (an idle-hang / a `TurnStatus::Failed` 429-overloaded-network blip) on a base
/// whose process is still ALIVE (`try_exit_status()` is `None`) PARKS the live
/// session back as `Primed` instead of tearing it down — the failure is still
/// surfaced, but the next follow-up reuses the bare resident session (no repo-map
/// re-scan, no full-transcript replay). It never panics.
///
/// The bounded first-turn auto-recovery gate is factored out into
/// [`chat_turn_should_auto_redrive`] so the ONE-shot bound is a pure, unit-tested
/// predicate rather than an inline condition that could silently rot into a loop.

///
/// This wrapper delegates every [`Backend`] method to the inner

///
/// 1. `DisableLineWrap` (DECAWM off, `\x1b[?7l`) — the CONTAINMENT half of the

///    explicitly positioned, so wrapping can only ever be a bug's amplifier. With

///    predicted (`·`, `─`, `—`, `…` in a CJK locale) pushes the row's tail past
///    the right margin, the terminal spills it onto the NEXT line, and the
///    corruption cascades down the whole screen — which ratatui's own-buffer diff
///    can never see, let alone repair. With DECAWM off the overflow is simply
///    dropped at the margin: the damage is contained to its own row, and the next
///    row's `MoveTo` re-anchors. (The re-anchoring backend then stops the row from
///    drifting at all — see [`AnchoredBackend`].)
/// 2. `EnableBracketedPaste` — multi-char bursts (clipboard paste AND CJK IME
///    commits, which most terminals deliver as a paste) arrive as one atomic
///    `Event::Paste` instead of a scrambled stream of `Char` events.
/// 3. Mouse capture per the CURRENT `/mouse` preference. On by default: we're
///    on the alternate screen (no native scrollback), where the terminal can't
///    give us BOTH wheel-scroll AND native click-drag copy — so UmaDev runs its
///    OWN selection layer (the Claude Code approach): capture the mouse, page
///    the transcript on the wheel, render the drag-selection highlight
///    ourselves, copy via OSC 52. `/mouse` toggles capture OFF for users who
///    prefer the terminal's native click-drag selection.
/// 4. `EnableFocusChange` (DEC private mode 1004). Some terminals — notably
///    the Windows console / Windows Terminal — scroll or redraw their own
///    buffer while unfocused, desyncing the incremental-diff render; with 1004
///    on, the terminal emits a FocusGained event on return and the event loop
///    forces a clean full repaint.
/// 5. `cursor::Show` — the blinking caret in the input box (positioned via
///    `frame.set_cursor_position` in `render_prompt`).
///
/// Shared by BOTH [`setup_terminal`] (startup) and [`reassert_terminal_modes`]
/// (long-input-gap / SIGCONT resume), so a level-triggered DEC private mode can
/// never be enabled at startup yet missed on resume — the "focus reporting
/// worked until a tmux re-attach" bug class. Add any future *level-triggered*
/// mode HERE and both paths get it; then add its symmetric disable to
/// [`restore_sequence`], which stays the single teardown (locked by
/// `enable_and_restore_are_mode_symmetric`).
///
/// The kitty keyboard protocol is the deliberate exception: it is a *stack*
/// push (`CSI > flags u`), not a level-triggered set, so re-pushing on every
/// resume would grow the terminal's stack unboundedly. It is therefore pushed
/// ONCE in [`setup_terminal`] (guarded by [`supports_keyboard_enhancement`])
/// and popped once in [`restore_sequence`], NOT re-asserted here.
///
/// Every escape is level-triggered, so the block is safe to run on every
/// resume. Every step is attempted even if an earlier one fails (a
/// resume must re-assert as much as it can); the FIRST error is returned so
/// startup can still abort and restore via its `fail` wrapper, while the

// Rendering self-heal.
//
// ratatui's flush diffs its OWN prev-buffer vs next-buffer and never
// reconciles against terminal reality: once the real screen DRIFTS (an
// ambiguous-width glyph the terminal rendered two columns wide where
// `unicode-width` predicted one, a terminal-side scroll, a mid-paint tear)
// while the two buffers are identical — the bottom-pinned steady state — the
// diff is EMPTY and the garble persists forever.
//
// The old escape was `terminal.clear()`: an `ED(2)` erase + a back-buffer
// reset. It worked, but the erase is the expensive, VISIBLE half — it blanks
// the screen for a beat (flicker on any terminal without honest DEC-2026), and
// crossterm's Windows `clear_entire_screen` explicitly `move_to(0, 0)`s, which
// is the cursor-sweep the user saw. So the heal is now split in two:
//
// * [`HealMode::Invalidate`] — DRIFT (streaming heartbeat, resize / focus /
//   size-poll settle). Reset ratatui's previous buffer WITHOUT touching the
//   screen ([`invalidate_frame`]): the next `draw()` then diffs against a
//   poisoned previous buffer, so it re-emits EVERY cell IN PLACE. No `ED(2)`,
//   no `move_to(0, 0)`, no flash, no dependence on synchronized-output support
//   — just the same cells, correctly positioned, painted over the drifted ones.
// * [`HealMode::Erase`] — true CONTAMINATION (an out-of-band write, `Ctrl+L` /
//   `/redraw`, a discrete layout transition): the screen genuinely holds bytes
//   we never wrote, so an erase is what the user asked for. One `terminal.clear()`,
//   once, on a discrete event — never on a cadence.
//
// All callers are fail-open; behavior is identical when no drift is present.
