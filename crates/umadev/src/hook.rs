//! Governance hook entry point — the `umadev hook pre-write` command.
//!
//! This is invoked by Claude Code or Kimi Code's `PreToolUse` hook
//! (registered via `umadev install`). It reads a PreToolUse JSON payload from stdin,
//! extracts the target file path + new content, runs the governance rules
//! (emoji / color / AI-slop), and prints a permission-decision JSON object
//! that both hosts honour to allow or deny the write.
//!
//! ## Claude Code PreToolUse payload shape (simplified)
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "tool_name": "Write",
//!   "tool_input": {
//!     "file_path": "src/Button.tsx",
//!     "content": "<button>🔍</button>"
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Decision output shape
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "hookSpecificOutput": {
//!     "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
//!     "permissionDecision": "deny",
//!     "permissionDecisionReason": "UmaDev: emoji detected..."
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//! When all rules pass, we emit `permissionDecision: "allow"`.
//!
//! Fail-open: if the payload can't be parsed or the tool isn't a write,
//! we allow (never block a legitimate operation on a parse error).
