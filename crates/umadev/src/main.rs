//! `umadev` — the single binary entrypoint.
//!
//! The recommended entry is to run the binary with **no subcommand**, which
//! launches the chat TUI. From there every feature is reachable via slash
//! commands (`/run`, `/continue`, `/backend`, `/status`, …).
//!
//! Subcommands exist for scripting / CI and for the architectural non-negotiable
//! real-time governance hook (called *by* a base CLI, not a human). The visible
//! surface is intentionally tiny:
//!
//! - (none)                  launch the chat TUI (the recommended entry)
//! - `init`                  write the `umadev.yaml` spec manifest
//! - `install --host <id>`   wire the real-time governance hook into a base CLI
//!
//! The rest (`run` / `continue` / `revise` / `spec` / `verify` / `deploy` /
//! `report` / `doctor` / `examples` / `guide` / `rollback` / `history`) are
//! hidden from `--help` but still work for scripts, and mirror TUI slash commands.
//! `hook` / `uninstall` are hidden internals.
//!
//! Anything outside this surface is intentionally absent.

             This project is managed by **UmaDev** ({version}), an AI coding project-director Agent.\n\n\
             ## How this works\n\n\
             1. UmaDev orchestrates a 9-phase pipeline (clarify → research → docs → spec → frontend → backend → quality → delivery).\n\
             2. During an active pipeline, UmaDev writes the dispatched phase's **coach prompt** to `.umadev/coach/CURRENT.md`.\n\
             3. The latest user message is the current objective. Read `CURRENT.md` only when the current turn explicitly dispatches that active phase (or the user explicitly asks to continue); the file's mere presence never authorizes resuming old work.\n\
             4. Existing plans, run notes, output documents, and earlier conversation are context only. Do not widen scope or fix adjacent issues unless the user asks.\n\
             5. After completing an explicitly active pipeline phase, run `umadev continue` to advance.\n\n\
             ## Rules (non-negotiable)\n\n\
             - **No emoji as functional icons** — use Lucide / Heroicons / Tabler icon libraries.\n\
             - **No hardcoded colors** — use CSS design tokens (Tailwind config).\n\
             - **No secrets in source code** — use environment variables.\n\
             - **Follow the spec preamble** in each coach prompt.\n\n\
             ## Governance\n\n\
             Your Write/Edit/Bash calls pass through UmaDev's governance hook. It is\n\
             fail-open: only the irreversible-if-written floor (hardcoded secrets /\n\
             credentials, sensitive-path writes to .git/.env/.ssh, destructive shell)\n\
             is HARD-BLOCKED at write time. Craft / quality findings (emoji-as-icons,\n\
             hardcoded colors, AI-slop) are FLAGGED and repaired by the post-write QC\n\
             loop — never hard-blocked mid-write, so a single nit can't stop you from\n\

/// Two safety-first modes:
///   - default (dry run): assess readiness, write the PR body, print the exact
///     branch/commit/PR plan — opens NOTHING.
///   - `--create`: when every readiness check passes, commit on a FEATURE
///     branch (creating one first if HEAD is on the default branch — never
///     committing directly on the default branch), push, and `gh pr create`
///     with the generated body.
///
/// Any failing precondition or external-command error prints the manual recipe
/// and returns a non-zero command result — never a crash, never a force-push,
/// never a rewrite of the user's existing commits. A requested publication that
/// did not happen must not look successful to a script or CI job.

///
/// Scoped to THIS run's `slug`, never the whole `output/`/`release/` dirs: those
/// accumulate artifacts across runs, so staging the entire dir would sweep a
/// PRIOR run's (or a different feature's) leftovers into this PR. The sanitized
/// slug is derived from the public [`umadev_agent::pr::pr_body_rel_path`]
/// (`output/<slug>-pr-body.md`),
/// so it matches the on-disk names for any slug without re-implementing a
