//! `umadev` — the single binary entrypoint.
//!
//! The recommended entry is to run the binary with **no subcommand**, which
//! launches the chat TUI. From there every feature is reachable via slash
//! commands (`/run`, `/continue`, `/backend`, `/status`, …).
//!
//! Subcommands exist for scripting / CI and for the architectural non-negotiable
//! real-time governance hook (called *by* a base CLI, not a human). The visible
//! surface is intentionally tiny:
//!
//! - (none)                  launch the chat TUI (the recommended entry)
//! - `init`                  write the `umadev.yaml` spec manifest
//! - `install --host <id>`   wire the real-time governance hook into a base CLI
//!
//! The rest (`run` / `continue` / `revise` / `spec` / `verify` / `report` /
//! `doctor` / `examples` / `guide` / `rollback` / `history`) are hidden from
//! `--help` but still work for scripts, and mirror TUI slash commands.
//! `hook` / `uninstall` are hidden internals.
//!
//! Anything outside this surface is intentionally absent.

             4. After completing the phase output, run `umadev continue` to advance.\n\n\
             ## Rules (non-negotiable)\n\n\
             - **No emoji as functional icons** — use Lucide / Heroicons / Tabler icon libraries.\n\
             - **No hardcoded colors** — use CSS design tokens (Tailwind config).\n\
             - **No secrets in source code** — use environment variables.\n\
             - **Follow the spec preamble** in each coach prompt.\n\n\
             ## Governance\n\n\
             Your Write/Edit/Bash calls are intercepted by UmaDev's governance hook.\n\
             Violations are blocked with a specific reason and fix suggestion.\n\
